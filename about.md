I'm a software developer, electronics tinkerer, modeller and musician based in Singapore.
My name is Paul Gallagher and you can easily find me on GitHub, Instagram etc - see the links above.

This blog is my occasional diary of Quite Interesting Things.

If these topics interest you, you may like some other sites I maintain:

* [LittleArduinoProjects](https://leap.tardate.com/) - a collection of electronics projects, often involving an Arduino
* [LittleCodingKata](https://codingkata.tardate.com/) - my notes and test code on software development topics and tools
* [LittleModeArt](https://codingkata.tardate.com/) - my collection of scale modelling, miniatures and other art projects

The blog itself is built with Jekyll and [hosted on GitHub in this repository](https://github.com/tardate/blog.tardate.com).
It uses the [pixyll.com](http://pixyll.com) template as a base.

It is a port and integration of two blogs I originally started on Blogger back in 2004.
If you notice styling glitches on older posts, it is likely due to an imperfect migration
that I haven't cleaned up yet!

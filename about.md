I'm a software developer, electronics tinkerer and wannabe guitarrista based in Singapore.
My name is Paul Gallagher and you can easily find me on GitHub, twitter etc - see the links above.

"tardate 2017" is my occasional diary of Quite Interesting Things.
It is a generally technical blog, meaning all things web, open source, data, electronics, and polyglot-programming.
Sometimes ravings on books or music bust in, and occasionally I'll be distracted with a rant or philosophical drivel.

If these topics interest you, you may like some other sites I maintain:

* [LittleArduinoProjects](http://leap.tardate.com/) - a collection of electronics projects, often involving an Arduino
* [LittleCodingKata](http://codingkata.tardate.com/) - my notes and test code on software development topics and tools

The blog itself is built with Jekyll and [hosted on GitHub in this repository](https://github.com/tardate/blog.tardate.com).
It uses the [pixyll.com](http://pixyll.com) template as a base.

It is a port and integration of two blogs I originally started on Blogger back in 2004.
If you notice styling glitches on older posts, it is likely due to an imperfect migration
that I haven't cleaned up yet!

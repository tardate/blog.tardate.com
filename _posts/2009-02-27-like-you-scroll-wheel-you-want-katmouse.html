I just heard about <a href="http://ehiti.de/katmouse/">KatMouse</a> on <a href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm">Security Now! #182</a>.<br /><br />I type fast, but love my mouse ( ... and there has been lot's of controversy about the <a href="/2008/03/desktop-keyboards-stuck-in-design-limbo.html">numeric keyboard getting in the way</a> too). <br /><br />That means I'm a scroll-wheel addict. Till now, I just accepted the fact that it doesn't kick in all the times I would naturally expect it to work, like old applications, or in controls or windows that don;t have focus.<br /><br />As soon as I heard <a href="http://www.grc.com/resume.htm">Steve</a> talk about <a href="http://ehiti.de/katmouse/">KatMouse</a> I knew I just had to get it. Two minutes later, it is installed and I'm loving it!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Best feature</span>: when I have overlapping windows, I can scroll whichever window the mouse is over. Doesn't have to be in focus. Beautiful! This is how the scroll wheel should have worked all along;-)

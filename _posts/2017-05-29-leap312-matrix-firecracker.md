I was a bit dubious about the possibility of creating a decent firecracker animation on the 24x5 Matrix display.
The additional PWM settings create another dimension, so the simulacrum is perhaps not so far off the mark.
To light the firecracker, I want to use a real fire of course;-)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

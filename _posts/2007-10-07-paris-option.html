It's not that I have anything against France, but reading
<a href="https://amzn.to/4ejEHEt" class="book-title">The Paris Option</a>
comes only a month
on the heels of <a href="/2007/08/hunter-killer.html"><strong>Hunter Killer</strong></a> - another terrorist
action thriller with the French cast as the villains.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Paris Option</strong> is another Covert-One novel in which Col. Jon Smith brings the world back
from the brink, ably assisted by CIA operative Randi Russell, MI6 renegade Peter Howell and computer genius
Marty Zellerbach. Its a rollicking good read, written by Gayle Lynds under the Robert Ludlum brand.<br>
<br>
Gayle Lynds also wrote
<a href="https://amzn.to/44eZg03" class="book-title">The Hades Factor</a>
, which is the first in the Covert-One series. Peter
Larkin is the other main writer in the series. Peter did
<a href="https://amzn.to/4lmOwDS" class="book-title">The Lazarus Vendetta</a>
and
<a href="https://amzn.to/4k86yc4" class="book-title">The Moscow Vector</a>
, which are the other books in the series that I have read.<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert-One_series">Covert-One</a> series works really well - similar
in a way the the Tom Clancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Force">Net Force</a> franchise - and I
look forward to reading the remaining novels.<br>
<br>

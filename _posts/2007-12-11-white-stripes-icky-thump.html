I heard the title track from The White Stripes'
<a href="https://amzn.to/46exN19" class="book-title">Icky Thump</a>
some time back. Think it might have
been on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice">BBC World Service</a>'s White Label. Finally picked up the
album last weekend.<br>
<br>
It's quirky playful, in a Sonic Youth kind of way, but perhaps with a more solid blues rock/bluegrass
sensibility. It gets stuck in your head. Love it.<br>

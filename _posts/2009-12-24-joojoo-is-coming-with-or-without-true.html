Michael Arrington hasn't been <a href=
"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/11/crunchpad-federal-lawsuit-filed-some-additional-thoughts/">shy about arguing his
position on the CrunchPad/joojoo story</a>, and until recently that's all we've really heard.<br>
<br>
Reading the <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/19283242/SF-38-303-C2_20091210160410_00000001">filing</a>, I had the
distinct feeling that everything wasn't so cut and dried as Mike claimed, and there's another story to tell.<br>

Andrew Warner's <a href="http://mixergy.com/joojoo-crunchpad-chandrasekar-rathakrishnan/">Mixergy interview</a> with

<br>
Besides, now having seen it .. I want a <a href="https://thejoojoo.com/">joojoo</a>! Short of an injunction, the
<a href="https://thejoojoo.com/">joojoo</a> is due to ship in the US in 8-10 weeks. It will be a real sad thing if the
legal wrangle scuttles the joojoo's chances to have a serious shot in the market.<br>

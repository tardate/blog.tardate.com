<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I finally got hold of Scott Berkun's <strong>The Myths of Innovation</strong> last week and read it in a day. It's thoughtful, eye-opening and funny to boot (even a few hidden gems, like way down at the very bottom of the ranked bibliography we find: <em>0, The Art of Project Management, Scott Berkun</em>!).<br /><br />In ten compelling chapters, the realisation is that <em>conventional wisdom</em> concerning innovation has it all backwards. These are the myths exploded:<br /><ul><li>The myth of epiphany<br /></li><li>We understand the history of innovation<br /></li><li>There is a method for innovation<br /></li><li>People love new ideas<br /></li><li>The lone inventor<br /></li><li>Good ideas are hard to find<br /></li><li>Your boss knows more about innovation than you<br /></li><li>The best ideas win<br /></li><li>Problems and solutions<br /></li><li>Innovation is always good<br /></li><br /></ul>The wierd thing is that you can probably read the list above (without referring to the book), recognise the "common belief", but with a moments thought understand why it is a myth. The strange things our brains do to us! <em>(more on this when I post my review of Jeff Hawkins excellent book <strong>On Intelligence</strong>)</em><br /><br />I'd highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in how we innovate, or a job role that is somehow related. That should mean pretty much everyone! No wonder this book hit #4 on <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2007/myths-of-innovation-4-on-amazons-best-of-2007/">Amazon's Best of 2007</a>. <br /><br /><blockquote class="quote">If I had 20 days to solve a problem, I would take 19 to define it - Albert Einstein</blockquote></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0596527055&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

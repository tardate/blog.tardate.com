<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I found <strong>The Best Laid Plans</strong> by Terry Fallis on the <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/the-best-laid-plans/">podiobooks.com</a> recommendation list, and I am so glad I did.<br /><br />This is a hartwarming story of a jaded political staffer rediscovering some of his idealism in the form of an Engineering Professor who becomes an accidental MP, turning parliament upside-down in the process. Mr Fallis has created an ensemble of wonderful and unconventional characters, and a story that you can enjoy on so many levels.<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=059542872X&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top" colspan="2"><a href="http://terryfallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/paper-in-the-house.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:10px 10px 0px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://terryfallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/paper-in-the-house.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>The <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/the-best-laid-plans/">podcast version</a> of the novel is a delight. It is like having Terry tell you the story while sitting on the balcony overlooking the Ottawa River, sipping a good whiskey. The short introductions he does for each episode - mentioning some of the feedback, and updating on publishing plans - lend that personal touch in a way that few have been able to equal. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.terryfallis.com/"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://terryfallis.com/wp-content/themes/TerryFallis/images/sidebar_bookcover.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>I'm pleased to see that the publishing deal has come through, and you can now find the Best Laid Plans in print on Amazon. I'm looking forward to my copy arriving soon so I can enjoy this story all over again in printed form (yes, that's how much I liked it!).<br /><br />Join the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2356091245">Friends of “The Best Laid Plans” Podcast</a> Facebook group, or check out the <a href="http://www.terryfallis.com/">author's site</a> for more information and his blog. Maybe we will see news of a sequel there in the not too distant future...<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

I mentioned in <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2007/07/log-buffer-54-carnival-of-vanities-for.html">Log Buffer #54</a> that "Patrick Wolf stumbled across an 11g feature that means <a href="http://inside-apex.blogspot.com/2007/07/oracle-11g-native-web-services.html">DBA's may put Java/SOA guys out of work</a>".<br /><br />Well I finally got myself setup with an 11g test system and the Native Web Services was the first thing I jumped at testing. <br /><br />Conclusions first?<br /><ul><li>Although perhaps not a blockbuster new feature, Native Web Services provide an easy solution for exposing data services into a SOAP-oriented application stack.</li><br /><li>For 11.1.0.5 (only), see <a href="http://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/ml2_documents.showDocument?p_database_id=NOT&p_id=444191.1">Metalink Note 444191.1</a> for updated installation instructions.</li><br /><li>The auto-generated XMLSchema and WSDL have some goofy features (like hyphens in method names) that may break SOAP client toolkit smarts.</li><br /><li>The is no real control over the generated XML payload, which will possibly limit the usefulness of Native Web Services for Enterprise SOA initiatives.</li><br /><li>The security model is simple but effective. The underlying database user role model provides authentication and access control.</li><br /><li>The ability to call arbitrary packages/procedures/functions is perhaps the most powerful feature. No incremental coding or configuration is required for each method. A good service interface is thus just a matter of careful procedure design and construction.</li><br /><li>I am less convinced that the ability to execute arbitrary SQL via Native Web Services is a good thing. It's not SOA, and it's not a good replacement for JDBC, ODP etc. Seems like just an invitation for bad hacks and shortcuts..</li><br /></ul><br />So, after a couple of hours of playing, I think maybe the Java/SOA guys don't have to panic just yet.. ;) <br /><br />Here's the blow-by-blow, where I describe the setup gotchas I hit, and my simple SOAP::Lite testing with Perl ..<br /><br /><strong>Initial Scan..</strong><br /><br />It took me a few moments to orient myself in the documentation; rather than being a distinct major new feature, Native Web Services are an enhancement of XML DB, and so the requisite documentation is mainly found in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28369/toc.htm">XML DB Developer's Guide</a>.<br /><br />The architecture of Native Web Services is quite simple. The main moving part is a servlet called 'orawsv' which brokers SOAP 1.1 requests and handles automatic WSDL generation. Out of the box, it is not enabled.<br /><br />The feature works in two main ways:<br /><ol><li>An arbitrary SQL DML request can be sent to the main 'oawsv' endpoint, and the results are returned as XML in the SOAP response.</li><br /><li>Procedures and functions may be invoked directly over SOAP.</li></ol><br /><strong>First Up - Configuration</strong><br /><br />Configuring Native Web Services is simply a matter of enabling the <strong>orawsv </strong>servlet, and then granting user access through role assignment. <br /><br />This is covered in <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28369/xdb_web_services.htm#CHDECACB">Chapter 33</a> of the docs. <br /><br />I first tried this with 11.1.0.5, and found that the role names mentionedd in the docs do not match (XDB_WEBSERVICES instead of XDBWEBSERVICES and so on). For an 11.1.0.5 install, refer to <a href="http://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/ml2_documents.showDocument?p_database_id=NOT&p_id=444191.1">Metalink Note 444191.1</a> for corrected installation instructions. In 11.1.0.6, role names correctly match the docs.<br /><br />The second thing I discovered (actually, a problem I created for myself then had to fix!) is that the servlet name <em>does matter</em>! The SERVLET_NAME (as in the setup code below) <strong>must</strong> be 'orawsv'.<br /><br />Thirdly, although you can set the URL pattern to anything you wish (and calls work), the auto-generated WSDL always assumes 'orawsv' when generating endpoint addresses. Effectively this means you must use 'orawsv' as the URL pattern also.<br /><em>NB: thanks to Christopher Burke for alerting me to the WSDL situation.</em><br /><blockquote class="code">DECLARE<br />  SERVLET_NAME VARCHAR2(32) := 'orawsv';<br />BEGIN<br />  DBMS_XDB.deleteServletMapping(SERVLET_NAME);<br />  DBMS_XDB.deleteServlet(SERVLET_NAME);<br />  DBMS_XDB.addServlet(NAME     =&gt; SERVLET_NAME,<br />                      LANGUAGE =&gt; 'C',<br />                      DISPNAME =&gt; 'Oracle Query Web Service',<br />                      DESCRIPT =&gt; 'Servlet for issuing queries as a Web Service',<br />                      SCHEMA   =&gt; 'XDB');<br />  DBMS_XDB.addServletSecRole(SERVNAME =&gt; SERVLET_NAME,<br />                             ROLENAME =&gt; 'XDB_WEBSERVICES',<br />                             ROLELINK =&gt; 'XDB_WEBSERVICES');<br />  DBMS_XDB.addServletMapping(PATTERN =&gt; '/orawsv/*',<br />                             NAME    =&gt; SERVLET_NAME);<br />END;<br />/<br />GRANT XDB_WEBSERVICES TO SCOTT;<br />GRANT XDB_WEBSERVICES_OVER_HTTP TO SCOTT;<br />GRANT XDB_WEBSERVICES_WITH_PUBLIC TO SCOTT;</blockquote><br />I couldn't quite figure out exactly why the 'orawsv' SERVLET_NAME is significant. It apparently just <em>is</em>, providing an explicit reference to the required servlet. The <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28419/d_xdb.htm#CHDBICDG">DBMS_XDB.addServlet docs</a> are unfortunately terse and unenlightening.<br /><br />So that all took me an hour more than it should. But not to worry - I am now up and running!<br /><br /><strong>Now What Can It Do? Testing a Function Call by Web Services..</strong><br /><br />I was particularly interested to see a procedural interface exposed via Web Services, so my first little test was to call a database function from Perl (using <a href="http://www.soaplite.com/">SOAP::Lite</a>). I created this very simple function in SCOTT:<br /><blockquote class="code">CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION empcount<br />RETURN NUMBER IS<br />emp_count number;<br />BEGIN<br />  SELECT count(*) INTO emp_count FROM emp;<br />  RETURN emp_count;<br />END;<br />/</blockquote><br />This becomes available at the endpoint 'http://server:port/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT', and the auto-generated WSDL is available at 'http://server:port/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT?wsdl'.<br /><br />Next I knocked up a bare-bones Perl client. Note the redefined <em>get_basic_credentials</em> method to provide the basic authentication credentials that are required.<br /><blockquote class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl -w<br />#<br />use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; 'debug';<br />sub SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Client::get_basic_credentials { <br />  return 'scott' =&gt; 'tiger';<br />}<br />my $serviceNs = 'http://xmlns.oracle.com/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT';<br />my $soap = SOAP::Lite<br />   -&gt;proxy('http://localhost:8080/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT');<br />my $som = $soap-&gt;call( SOAP::Data-&gt;name('SNUMBER-EMPCOUNTInput')-&gt;attr({'xmlns' =&gt; $serviceNs}) );<br />print &quot;The response from the server was:&quot; . $som-&gt;result . &quot;\n&quot;;</blockquote><br />And the answer is .. 14;) [see the end notes below for the request/reply transcript].<br /><br />As you can see, pretty simple, but it should be simpler. One liners should be possible, like this:<br /><blockquote class="code">print SOAP::Lite-&gt; service('http://scott:tiger@localhost:8080/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT?wsdl')-&gt;EMPCOUNT();</blockquote><br />... but you'll notice that the 11g generated method names (like 'SNUMBER-EMPCOUNTInput') have annoying hyphens, which subverts the smart typing and dynamic binding that kits like SOAP::Lite are capable of. Doh!<br /><br />Closest I can get is this:<br /><blockquote class="code">print &quot;The response from the server was: &quot;;<br />print SOAP::Lite<br />   -&gt;uri('http://xmlns.oracle.com/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT')<br />   -&gt;proxy('http://localhost:8080/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT')<br />   -&gt;call ( 'SNUMBER-EMPCOUNTInput' )<br />   -&gt;result;</blockquote><br /><br /><strong>Endnotes - EMPCOUNT SOAP Request and Response</strong> <br /><blockquote class="code"><em>{The request ... }</em><br />SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Client::send_receive: POST http://localhost:8080/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT HTTP/1.1<br />Accept: text/xml<br />Accept: multipart/*<br />Accept: application/soap<br />Content-Length: 461<br />Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8<br />SOAPAction: &quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT#SNUMBER-EMPCOUNTInput&quot;<br /><br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br />&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; <br />xmlns:soapenc=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot; <br />xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; <br />soap:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot; <br />xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;soap:Body&gt;<br />&lt;SNUMBER-EMPCOUNTInput xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT&quot; xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;<br />&lt;/soap:Body&gt;<br />&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;<br /><br /><em>{The response ... }</em><br />SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Client::send_receive: HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />Server: Oracle XML DB/Oracle Database<br />Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8<br />Client-Date: Mon, 13 Aug 2007 16:06:28 GMT<br />Client-Peer: 127.0.0.1:8080<br />Client-Response-Num: 1<br />Client-Transfer-Encoding: chunked<br />DAV: 1,2,&lt;http://www.oracle.com/xdb/webdav/props&gt;<br />MS-Author-Via: DAV<br /><br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;<br />&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;<br />  &lt;soap:Body&gt;<br />    &lt;EMPCOUNTOutput xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/orawsv/SCOTT/EMPCOUNT&quot;&gt;<br />      &lt;RETURN&gt;14&lt;/RETURN&gt;<br />    &lt;/EMPCOUNTOutput&gt;<br />  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;<br />&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;</blockquote>

This sounds great, and congrats to the winners of <a href=
"http://sgentrepreneurs.com/tag/zimplistic/">Start-Up@Singapore 2009</a> for the <span style=
"font-weight:bold;">Zimplistic Rotimatic</span>.<br>
<br>
But I want to know ... can it also do the perfect prata?<br>

<blockquote class="quote">
  Chapati or roti is a staple in Indian diet. Yet it can take over 30 minutes to prepare a simple meal of roti.
  Repeating this at least three times every day is a cumbersome process.<br>
  <br>
  Zimplistic’s invention is an elegant automatic roti-maker set to be the rice cooker of India. With a push of a
  button, the roti-maker can mix, make and bake rotis from just the addition of water and flour to the machine.<br>
  <br>
  Zimplistic’s founder Pranoti Nagarkar Israni is no stranger to product design. Only in her 20s, she left her job at a
  leading electronic manufacturer to start-up on her own. She graduated from NUS and majored in mechanical engineering.
  Zimplistic aims to go one step further by developing more innovations such as the roti-maker, to make every meal more
  convenient to make and consume.

        I've been meaning to pick this up for some years, and finally did while killing a few hours at KLIA. And I'm
        glad I did, devouring it last weekend.<br>
        <br>
        It is a great read, no matter what views you may personally hold about Larry or Oracle itself. So many things
        about the way you see Oracle operate today are given a rich historical background. Fascinating. And remarkably
        balanced ... I'd say its still 50/50 whether you'll finish the book with more or less respect for Larry and
        Oracle.<br>
        <br>
        Since the final touches to the epilogue were made in March 2004 (just on the verge of the PeopleSoft
        acquisition), it was a bit like watching “Fellowship of the Ring”. The story is unfinished and you can’t wait
        for the next episode of the saga to come out. But despite it being a few years old, I think it remains a highly
        recommended read especially if you work in enterprise computing. I do hope Matthew Symonds gets to continue the
        story in another book (a SQL?).<br>

Potted music chips! Figuring them out is half the fun;-)
The H823 chip arrived in kit and so far I have been unable to find a source for the music chip alone, or indeed anything approximating a datasheet.
But after a bit of tinkering, I was able to get it sussed and control it in all its 1-bit glory..
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

The DPS3005 is one of a range of popular DC power supply modules; this one is designed for up to 32V/5A DC output.
For this project, I am mounting the module in a project case, and adding a rectified step-down transformer so
the unit is powered from mains AC.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

I joined the Boldport Club rather late, but manage to snaffle up the Emergency kit PCB in sale of "Just Less the Perfect" boards.
Since I'm working with just the PCB, there's an obvious challenge to do something a bit different.
After a bit of experimentation, I was able to get something to work with only a few liberties taken with the original PCB - it is now an LED blinky with 3 passives and a transistor (Esaki Effect)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

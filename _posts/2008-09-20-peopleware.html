Especially because it sweats the little things, like office furniture, interview techniques, and the evils of the telephone.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0932633439&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>My favourite phrase in the book:<blockquote class="quote">Management by Hysterical Optimism</blockquote>Haven't we all seen that in action at some time? (unfortunately)<br /><br />The authors do however take a little liberty in claiming the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a> says people perform better when they're trying something new. Which I believe to be true, but isn't exactly what the Hawthorn effect is (people will be more productive when appreciated or when watched).<br /><br />My report is not all good however. There more I read into the book, the more I felt the authors' advice was biased towards a certain ideal organisation that is I think by no means universally applicable. <br /><br />In short: workers all strive to be master craftsmen; they provide their own motivation, vision and goals; management is best advised to just provide the creature comforts and get out of their way.<br /><br />While many may relate to this (personally I do too), as a general theory of management I think it is a crock. In the 60's they would have called this 'flower power'. In the 50's it would have been labeled a 'communist conspiracy'. <br /><br />No, I think the real world is a little more complex than that. But Peopleware nevertheless delivers a great deal of practical advice.<br /><br /><h3>Seven False Hopes of Software Management</h3><br />My favourite "list" from the book...<br /><ul><li>There is some new trick you've missed that could send productivity soaring</li><br /><li>Other managers are getting gains of 100% or more</li><br /><li>Technology is moving so swiftly that you're being passed by.</li><br /><li>Changing languages will give you huge gains</li><br /><li>Because of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately</li><br /><li>You automate everything else; isn't it about time to automate your development staff away?</li><br /><li>Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure</li></ul><br />With a preference for the decimal system, I have the temerity to add:<br /><ul><li>Build it and they will come!</li><br /><li>We just need a SOA architecture!</li><br /><li>It's going to take too long/cost too much, so can you revise your estimates?</li></ul>

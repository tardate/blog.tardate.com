Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a> by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister is
often cited as the classic software development management text; one that rightfully puts the focus on
people.<br>
<br>
So I had heard about it long before finally getting around to reading it recently.<br>
<br>
It is a really good collection of insights, suggestions and anti-patterns that makes a great read, and good
food for thought. Especially because it sweats the little things, like office furniture, interview techniques,
and the evils of the telephone.
<br>
<br>
My favourite phrase in the book:
<blockquote class="quote">
  Management by Hysterical Optimism
</blockquote>Haven't we all seen that in action at some time? (unfortunately)<br>
<br>
The authors do however take a little liberty in claiming the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a> says people perform better when they're trying
something new. Which I believe to be true, but isn't exactly what the Hawthorn effect is (people will be more
productive when appreciated or when watched).<br>
<br>
My report is not all good however. There more I read into the book, the more I felt the authors' advice was biased
towards a certain ideal organisation that is I think by no means universally applicable.<br>
<br>
In short: workers all strive to be master craftsmen; they provide their own motivation, vision and goals; management is
best advised to just provide the creature comforts and get out of their way.<br>
<br>
While many may relate to this (personally I do too), as a general theory of management I think it is a crock. In the
60's they would have called this 'flower power'. In the 50's it would have been labeled a 'communist conspiracy'.<br>
<br>
No, I think the real world is a little more complex than that. But Peopleware nevertheless delivers a great deal of
practical advice.<br>

<h3>
  Seven False Hopes of Software Management
</h3><br>
My favourite "list" from the book...<br>
<ul>
  <li>There is some new trick you've missed that could send productivity soaring
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Other managers are getting gains of 100% or more
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Technology is moving so swiftly that you're being passed by.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Changing languages will give you huge gains
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Because of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>You automate everything else; isn't it about time to automate your development staff away?
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure
  </li>
</ul><br>
With a preference for the decimal system, I have the temerity to add:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Build it and they will come!
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We just need a SOA architecture!
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>It's going to take too long/cost too much, so can you revise your estimates?
  </li>
</ul>

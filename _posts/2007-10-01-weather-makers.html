        My sister gave me a copy of Tim Flannery's <strong>The Weather Makers</strong> for my birthday
        (<em>thanks!</em>) but it sat in my reading queue for half a year. I packed it when travelling last week and
        once picked up, was not put down. I wouldn't say this is a happy or hopeful book to read, but it is important.
        I'm glad this is a best seller, but I'd be happier if we see that translated into action.<br>
        <br>
        I guess the three facts of importance
        <ol>
          <li>that climate change is upon us - we have reached the tipping point
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>that the change is for the worse - the only disagreement being about the specific effects our planet will
          need to endure
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>that while human activity is not the only contributor, we know that it is a factor, and more importantly
          we know ways in which our impact can be lessened
          </li>
        </ol>So the question is no longer "should we act" but "will we?"<br>
        <br>
        I particularly liked the quotes that Mr Flannery uses to introduce each chapter. For example from Alfred Russel
        Wallace:<br>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          It is amongst those nations that claim to be the most civilised, those that profess to be guided by a
          knowledge of laws of nature, those that most glory in the advance of science, that we find the greatest
          apathy, the greatest recklessness, in continually rendering impure this important necessity of life...
        </blockquote>The astonishing point to note is that this is from 1903. It is sobering to realise that the
        warning bell has been ringing for well over a century, but humanity is nothing if not a master of allowing
        short term goals undermine the future. Of course, it has always been quite valid to answer the question of
        climate change with a "Pish!" Well, that is until 2005 when finally we had the published, refereed scientific
        proof that global warming is in fact, fact.<br>
        <br>
        Read this before it is too late!<br>

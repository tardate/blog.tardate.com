I've had two blogs kicking around on blogger.com since around 2004 - [tardate][tardate] and [pratalife][pratalife].
I decided to try porting and combining them on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll][jekyll].

This is the result, [hosted on GitHub in this repository](https://github.com/tardate/blog.tardate.com).
If you notice styling glitches on older posts, it is likely due to an imperfect migration
that I haven't cleaned up yet.

I started out using the built-in [minima][minima] theme,
but subsequently switched to largely borrow most of the [pixyll.com][pixyll] template
as it offers a very good mix of pre-configured features useful for a blog
(responsive design, social integration).

There's nothing like a "financial correction" to make people wake up and start sniffing the crap that has been shoveled
their way.<br>
<br>
Waddya know? <a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2009/01/soa-is-dead-long-live-services.html">SOA is dead</a> says
Burton.<br>
<br>
If I was paying for Burton services, I would be asking for a refund and an explanation as to why it took so long to
identify the bleedin' obvious<br>
<br>
The irony may have been a bit thick for anyone to realise that my story of <a href=
"/2007/10/ode-to-soa-story-of-eric-architect.html">Eric the Architect</a> was little more than a lampoon on the
generations of IT attempting to find a home within business (true friend - true story - honest!!!).<br>
<br>
Guys - pragmatism rules. SOA never had anything to do with the bottom-line. Directly. And the indirect contributions
lacked evidence and credibility.<br>
<br>
In an excess of pragmatism, Miko Matsumura shut down the <a href="http://www.soacenter.com/?p=172">SOA center blog</a>
on the back of the Burton article. The new blog will be called the <a href="http://whatevercenter.com">Whatever
Center</a>. Love the name, but will the dns changes ever propagate? I hope so, for Matsumura-san's integrity. Unlike
<a href="http://thedailywtf.com">WFT</a>s transition to <a href=
"http://thedailywtf.com/Comments/Announcement-WebsiteRenameTo(The-Daily-WTH).aspx?pg=3">WTH</a>, this is not a
joke.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm with <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2009/01/soa_dawn_of_the_dead.html">Justin Kestelyn</a>:<br>

  The problems remain with us, whatever we choose to call the solution.

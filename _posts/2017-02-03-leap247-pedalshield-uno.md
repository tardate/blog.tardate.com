In the [AudioDSP](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/playground/AudioDSP) project,
I built an Arduino pedal/DSP unit based on the Electrosmash pedalSHIELD design.
It worked well enough that I wanted to build the "real thing", not only to give myself a good baseline on expected performance,
but also to payback Electrosmash in a small way. Good OSH deserves support!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

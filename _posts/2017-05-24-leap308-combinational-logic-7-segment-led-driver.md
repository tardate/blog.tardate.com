Ben Eater published a fantastic video/tutorial on designing a 7-segment hex decoder as an adjunct to his 8-bit breadboard computer quest.
The first thought was of course "that's an awful lot of work just to drive a 7-segment display .. lucky we don't have to do that these days!"
My next thought was naturally: "OK, now let's build it!".
It was in fact a great excuse to dust off some combinational logic methods.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Finding some neat pushwheel/thumbwheel decade switches seemed like all the excuse I needed
to build a 7-digit [decade box/decade programmable resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_box)
.. an old-fashioned bit of test equipment, allowing an arbitrary resistance to be dialed up to order.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

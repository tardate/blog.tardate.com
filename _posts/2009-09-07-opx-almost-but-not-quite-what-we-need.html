A post today by Dana Gardner - <a href="http://www.it-director.com/business/change/content.php?cid=11518">Cloud adoption needs a support spectrum of technology, services, best practices</a> - got me thinking again about the importance of a universal "business" identity to make cloud computing a reality for the enterprise sector.<br /><br />I wrote some time ago about <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2008/07/openid-missing-spice-in-enterprise-20.html">OpenID - the missing spice in Enterprise 2.0?</a> The basic premise being that for Enterprises to truely exploit the exploding cloud offerings, they first need a way of <span style="font-style:italic;">exporting</span> business identities to the web.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2008/07/openid-missing-spice-in-enterprise-20.html"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SHLaZo6jp8I/AAAAAAAAAYU/KzV4A_LPMTY/s400/openid-now.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>While most businesses at the moment have not <span style="font-style:italic;">officially</span> adopted cloud services, the reality is that cloud services are already penetrating all organisations - whether it is sales people keeping touch with contacts on <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, pre-sales engineers collaborating via <a href="http://docs.google.com">google docs</a>, or consultants using <a href="http://drop.io">drop.io</a> to get around email size restrictions when sending documents to partners and customers.<br /><br />The issue I wrote about in my <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2008/07/openid-missing-spice-in-enterprise-20.html">previous post</a> is that we need to wake up and recognise that the flood gates are already open: we are mixing personal and business identities in a tangled mess that is becoming harder to unravel each day.<br /><br />The risk for business? While free cloud services are giving a tactical boost, when employees move on, they will take all of their cloud-attached contributions with them. At best, a relationship management issue to recover, at worst you find all kinds of SOX and compliance issues lurking to bite back. <br /><br />Now pretty much all IT-enabled organisations have a form of internal directory and authentication service (be it AD or an LDAP variant). My premise is that organisation <span style="font-weight:bold;">do</span> want to be able to exploit <a href="http://www.google.com/a">google apps</a>, <a href="http://www.zoho.com">Zoho</a> or <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, but when doing so, we should care deeply that employees apply their business (not personal) identity to any transaction.<br /><br />From a technologist's point of view, this essentially means that we want to take our internal authentication processes and expose them in a very controlled way on the web. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">SAML</a> was the deathstar standards approach, but I think in reality <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a> has won the hearts and minds at this point.<br /><br />One of my projects-on-the-drawingboard is an OpenID provider designed for the Enterprise - a drop in module that allows you to export internal identities from AD or LDAP in a very controlled and auditable way. <span style="font-style:italic;">It is still on the drawing board and has been for ages - if others are interested in making it reality, <a href="mailto:gallagher.paul@gmail.com">drop me a line</a>.</span><br /><br />However, I think the options may already be available. I am talking about <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/opx">janrain's OPX</a>, although I'm not sure that any of their offerings are really designed for this specific scenario. Even the <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/opxgroups">OPX:Groups</a> offering, which seems to be the closest seems to require establishing a new directory of identities rather than leverging your existing assets. I may be wrong... still investigating and certainly appreciate a steer in the right direction.

I am inspired once again by one of [w2aew's excellent vidoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6cmkm3UPUI)
to revisit the basics of biasing and operating classes of the common-emitter amplifier.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Just a quick test of the TS3A5018 digital switch which I am looking at for an application in switching amplifier gain stages.

The TS3A5018 is a 1.8 to 3.6V device with four SPDT switches controlled from a single input, and a master active-low enable pin.
It is guaranteed break-before-make (max 58ns).

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

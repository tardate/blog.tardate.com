        <span style="font-style:italic;">uush .. I take a deep breath and prepare for the perilous task of blogging
        about a book that is all about writing well.</span><br>
        <br>
        I know my writing can be lazy and prone to opacity (to all except me of course), but I do enjoy reading about
        writing.<br>
        <br>
        However, too many books attempt to just lay down the law - albeit with a garnish of humorous anecdotes - and
        any 'learning' is short-lived.<br>

        the problem is not that we don't know the rules. The root cause of our troubles is more fundamental.

Bad writing is an addiction; an -ism that is given to misdirect your pen. We are gripped by <span style=
"font-weight:bold;">malescribism</span>.<br>
<br>
And just like any other condition, a cure is possible given the right intervention. Which is what this book provides
(as you can probably guess, planting tongue firmly in cheek is the first prerequisite to recovery).<br>
<br>
In 12 easy steps, we learn to overcome our denial, pride, and insecurity, then find the courage to begin the journey to
enlightenment:
<ul>
  <li>Accept the fact that bad writing happens.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Admit you've willingly made writing mistakes .
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Believe that Standard English can heal you.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing weak sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing formal sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing overweight sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing unclear sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing careless sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing unpersuasive sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing incongruous sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing unstructured sentences.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop writing unsightly sentences.
  </li>
</ul><br>
<br>
If I can only recommend one book on the craft of writing, this is it. Wherever you use English - school reports, blogs,
business proposals, or novels - this book can help you do so more effectively, more efficiently and more enjoyably.<br>

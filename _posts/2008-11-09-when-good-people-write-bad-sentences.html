<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><span style="font-style:italic;">uush .. I take a deep breath and prepare for the perilous task of blogging about a book that is all about writing well.</span><br /><br />I know my writing can be lazy and prone to opacity (to all except me of course), but I do enjoy reading about writing. <br /><br />However, too many books attempt to just lay down the law - albeit with a garnish of humorous anecdotes - and any 'learning' is short-lived.<br /><br />Robert W. Harris' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312328044?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312328044">When Good People Write Bad Sentences</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0312328044" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> doesn't make this mistake. He knows the problem is not that we don't know the rules. The root cause of our troubles is more fundamental.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0312328044&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">(also available from the <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/0312328044/good-people-write-bad-sentences-12">Singapore National Library</a>)</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Bad writing is an addiction; an -ism that is given to misdirect your pen. We are gripped by <span style="font-weight:bold;">malescribism</span>.<br /><br />And just like any other condition, a cure is possible given the right intervention. Which is what this book provides (as you can probably guess, planting tongue firmly in cheek is the first prerequisite to recovery).<br /><br />In 12 easy steps, we learn to overcome our denial, pride, and insecurity, then find the courage to begin the journey to enlightenment:<ul><li>Accept the fact that bad writing happens.</li><br /><li>Admit you've willingly made writing mistakes .</li><br /><li>Believe that Standard English can heal you.</li><br /><li>Stop writing weak sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing formal sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing overweight sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing unclear sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing careless sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing unpersuasive sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing incongruous sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing unstructured sentences.</li><br /><li>Stop writing unsightly sentences.</li></ul><br /><br />If I can only recommend one book on the craft of writing, this is it. Wherever you use English - school reports, blogs, business proposals, or novels - this book can help you do so more effectively, more efficiently and more enjoyably. <br /><br /><h3>The Recovering Malescribe's Bill of Rights</h3><ul><li>I have the right to embrace Standard English.</li><br /><li>I have the right to respect my inner child-writer.</li><br /><li>I have the right to improve my writing skills without aiming for perfection.</li><br /><li>I have the right to create sentences without being motivated by bad emotions.</li><br /><li>I have the right to spell better than those around me.</li><br /><li>I have the right to be grammatically correct.</li><br /><li>I have the right to punctuate correctly without apology.</li><br /><li>I have the right to edit my work.</li><br /><li>I have the right to cooperate with my readers.</li><br /><li>I have the right to give myself permission to be a healthy writer.</li></ul>

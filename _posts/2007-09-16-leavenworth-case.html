I've enjoyed listening to
<a href="https://amzn.to/3TDtIvR" class="book-title">The Leavenworth Case</a>
by <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Katharine_Green">Anna Katharine Green</a> over the past week. Kirsten
Ferreri reads it with a suitably "Victorian" overture for LibriVox, where it is available as a <a href=
"http://librivox.org/the-leavenworth-case-by-anna-katharine-green/">podcast download</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3TDtIvR" class="book-title">The Leavenworth Case</a>
was published in 1878, and is a nicely complicated murder mystery. The
true culprit remains well veiled until a classic drawing-room climax. Apparently the book was praised for the
mastery of legal points and was used at Yale University to demonstrate the fallacy of circumstantial
evidence.<br>

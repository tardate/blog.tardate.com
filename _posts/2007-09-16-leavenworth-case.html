<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I've enjoyed listening to <strong>The Leavenworth Case</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Katharine_Green">Anna Katharine Green</a> over the past week. Kirsten Ferreri reads it with a suitably "Victorian" overture for LibriVox, where it is available as a <a href="http://librivox.org/the-leavenworth-case-by-anna-katharine-green/">podcast download</a>.<br /><br /><strong>The Leavenworth Case</strong> was published in 1878, and is a nicely complicated murder mystery. The true culprit remains well veiled until a classic drawing-room climax. Apparently the book was praised for the mastery of legal points and was used at Yale University to demonstrate the fallacy of circumstantial evidence.<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=1406500151&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

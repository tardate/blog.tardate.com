The Boldport Cordwood proved to be an instant classic.
A few LED animations using the Cordword library written by aaronjasso is a good way to show it off.
Little did I know that months later, the demo would [show up in a hackaday article!](http://hackaday.com/2017/03/24/retrotechtacular-tinkertoy-and-cordwood-in-the-pre-ic-era/)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

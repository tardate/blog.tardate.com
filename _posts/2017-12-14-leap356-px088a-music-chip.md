Another potted music chip! Figuring them out is half the fun;-)

The PX088A is a simple, nondescript single-tune chip. Found out it plays the main theme from Beethoven's Für Elise.
The recommended configuration turned out to be a battery killer, but I was able to get it working with a few adjustments.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

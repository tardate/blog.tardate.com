The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module is commonly used with a microcontroller for obstacle detection and other autonomous control functions.
But that doesn't mean it can't be used in circuits that lack a processor.
Silicon Chip featured an article by Jim Rowe in the Dec-2016 edition that described Using An Ultrasonic Sensor Module As A Door Sentry,
so I built something similar!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

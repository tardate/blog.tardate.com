More of my minor obsession with digital potentiometers!
The MCP42010 dual digital potentiometer is pretty nifty. And two channels means it is possible to control
two inputs for an XY plot on an oscilloscope. So time to get drawing!
Of course, the first thing to try is the classic Christmas Tree.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

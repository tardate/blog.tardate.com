My neighbour is developing a prototyping system called Chain Blocks by PrexLab, and passed me some to try out.
Since I've got digital pots on the brain at the moment .. time for yet more doodling on an oscilloscope!
So I made an "X-Y Plotter Chain Block".
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

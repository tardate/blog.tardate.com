<a href="http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm#101">Security Now! #101</a> with Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte covered the
deceptively <a href=

differentiating human from non-human automated clients (great podcast as always .. check it out). Commonly this is done
with distorted text like the sample on the right.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">Official CAPTCHA Site</a> has a wealth of information about this field, including
discussion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha#Human_solvers">relay attack</a> that has the potential
to defeat <em>any</em> "are you a human?" test (because it enrolls unwitting human accomplices to do the work).<br>
<br>
The coolest piece of work though is the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA</a> project. This is a project of the
School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, and it provides a public service for plugging-in a CAPTCHA to
your site. But unlike other systems that are just wasting 10 seconds of your time, this system is actually
<strong>digitizing public domain archives</strong> at the same time (getting you to fix the translation of words that
have defied the best OCR software)!<br>
<br>
Perl is one language that you can easily use reCAPTCHA with, using Andy Armstrong's <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/~andya/Captcha-reCAPTCHA/lib/Captcha/reCAPTCHA.pm">Captcha::reCAPTCHA</a> module.<br>
<br>
After installing the module, it just takes a few minutes to register your site and setup a test page. I built a quick
reCAPTCHA cgi in perl .. you can try it out <a href="http://paulg.homelinux.com:8000/cgi-bin/myReCaptcha.pl">here</a>
(<i>sorry, currently may find it offline</i> but get the script source here: <a href=
"http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master%2FmyReCaptcha.pl?raw=true">myReCaptcha.pl</a>. <em>I think I spent 10
minutes setting this up, and then an hour playing with it;) All in the name of digitizing historical works...</em><br>
<br>
But I'm afraid <a href="http://www.thehumorarchives.com/">the humour archive</a> has the best captcha ever ..<br>

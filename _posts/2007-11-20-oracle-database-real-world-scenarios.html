If you are a serious database specialist in or around Singapore, I recommend you check out the <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/education/images/apac_newsletter/ttseminar.pdf">Oracle Database: Real World Scenarios -
Troubleshooting and Tuning Seminar</a> that has been put together for Oracle University by Aat van Bart. It is running
on 6th &amp; 7th Dec.<br>
<br>
Aat is one of my ex-collegues, so I know when he talks "real world" you can be sure this is the real deal;-)<br>
<br>
This is one of a <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=3">series of
special events</a> that Oracle University in Singapore have organised. Next is Steven Feuerstein's <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/education/images/apac_newsletter/sg_steven1.html">The Best of PL/SQL</a>.

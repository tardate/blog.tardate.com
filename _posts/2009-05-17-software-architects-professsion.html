</blockquote><br>
I hesitated as I reached for
<a href="https://amzn.to/4kWkbMr" class="book-title">The Software Architect's Profession: An Introduction (Software Architecture Series)</a>
on the library shelf.<br>
<br>
Did I really want to read another treatise on the role of the software architect? Hasn't the term <span style=
"font-style:italic;">architect</span> been so abused as to now be worthless, even downright counter-productive?
In this, I think I am one with Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky who discussed the questionable value of the title
"Software Architect" on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/podcast-44/">StackOverflow podcast
#44</a>.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, my hand followed through. I think I was persuaded by the unimposing nature of this concise little
100-page book.
<br>
<br>
I was pleasantly surprised; this is a great little book for stimulating some thinking around the role of an
architect <span style="font-style:italic;">for the advanced reader</span>. But I worry that it attempts to position
itself as "An Introduction". A novice, unprepared to read the text critically, may easily be mislead by the book's
definitive statements about what a software architect is and what they do.<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe the book is fundamentally flawed in three important aspects:<br>
<br>
<h2>
  1. Are we really in Crisis because we lack a Software Architecture Profession?
</h2><br>
Firstly, the premise that today's Crisis in Software -<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  [the] parade of failures and half-failures that has grown over the years as a result of a world without an
  established profession of software architecture
</blockquote><br>
- is wholly unsupported by any direct evidence. The authors' central argument is flawed by asserting an <span style=
"font-style:italic;">apparent</span> causal relationship when in fact only coincidence had been established beyond
doubt. A number of well-known software runaways and failures are mentioned, but I don't know of any where the original
case studies attributed the failure primarily to the lack of "an established profession of software architecture". The
authors get around this problem by redefining the conclusions and suggesting that all faults may eventually be
explained by architecture. It seems to me self-serving and circular.<br>
<br>
<h2>
  2. A Flawed Analogy with Building Construction
</h2><br>
Second, the authors attempt to reinforce their argument with the proposition that the analogy with building
architecture is self-evident. Buildings need architects. Software is like building. Therefore software needs
architects. Hmmm. I am reminded of Bernard Rudofsky's book "The Prodigious Builders" which celebrates the history of
<span style="font-style:italic;">vernacular architecture</span>. That is, architecture without Architects
(unfortunately a stunningly boring book for what ought to be a highly inspirational subject).<br>
<br>
I particularly disagree with the authors' contention that software is not <span style=
"font-style:italic;">developed</span>: it is <span style="font-style:italic;">built</span> (with a sense of finality).
The Google-inspired trend towards the <span style="font-weight:bold;">perpetual beta</span> is the most visible
evidence to the contrary. The authors object to the notion that <span style="font-style:italic;">to develop</span>
implies to unfold, uncover, and make known. On the contrary, I find this a most apt description of what we do within
the software profession: the youth and continuing innovation within the field does mean that software development and
the architecture it requires is more akin to exploration, invention and discovery than to a formalised application of
the tried and true.<br>
<br>
Strike two.<br>
<br>
<h2>
  3. Premature Specialisation
</h2><br>
I began to renew my hope for the book as it explored the historical foundations of architecture. Michelangelo can truly
lay claim to the title of Architect ("master builder"); his work on St Peter's Basilica epitomizes the unltimate
balance between function, beauty, and structure,<br>
<br>
<a href=
"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/441px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg">
<img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 110px" src=
"/assets/2009-05-17-software-architects-professsion/441px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> is famous for asserting in his book <span style=
"font-style:italic;">De architectura</span> circa 50BC that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas,
utilitas, venustas â€” that is, it must be strong or durable, useful, and beautiful. A sense of proportion and harmony is
represented in Leonardo Da Vinci's famous illustration of <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man">Vitruvian Man</a>.<br>
<br>
Such ideas begin to shape the conventional definition of an architect. A master who not only understands structure,
utility, and beauty in order to successfully render a design into plans, but has the practical experience to supervise
their realisation through construction.<br>
<br>
At this point, I think the authors are getting onto the right track. However they stumble at the last post by then
inexplicably turning this into an argument for a limited and specialised concept of a "Software Architecture
Profession", where the architect only retains responsibility for <span style="font-style:italic;">venustas</span>
(design/beauty). <span style="font-style:italic;">Utilitas</span> (function/utility) is the client's problem, and
<span style="font-style:italic;">firmitas</span> (form, materials, logistics) is the province of the engineers,
scientists and code monkeys.<br>
<br>
<h2>
  Time for the Renaissance?
</h2><br>
The authors' call for the codification and ossification of a software architecture practice is I think at least 50
years premature.<br>
<br>
What an "Architect" needs to be concerned with is still going through successive waves of tumultuous change. Up to the
green-screen era, computer system architecture necessarily had a strong hardware component. Come the GUIs and
increasing processing power in the 90s, it seemed a singular focus on "software architecture" as a technical discipline
was a valid vocation. Now the waves of web-driven innovation and the emergence of the "Rich Internet Application" is
again challenging our notions of what architecture entails. And again, the "real world" is encroaching the pure
software realm with the rise of increasingly powerful and widely available mobile computing platforms (think iPhone,
Android), and the revolution in pervasive automation (think Arduino).<br>
<br>
I think the Java Posse were spot on when they discussed the growing need for cross-fertilisation and collaboration
between designers and developers on <a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=473708">podcast #247 - Design and
Engineering</a>. This is a time of divergence, not convergence, in the business of producing software &amp;
technology-based systems.<br>
<br>
In truth, I question how appropriate both words are in the term "Software Architect":<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Software</span> - it is perhaps only in the last 10-20 years that it has been
    possible to construct computer software at the level of complexity that warrants the existence of an architect in
    the classical sense. And I suspect that in another 10 years it will seem ludicrous to suggest that you can be an
    Architect of only software ("just a turn-of-the-century fad"). Software is just one component of a "built
    environment" that encompasses everything from the information infrastructure and systems technology to the
    psychology, art and design of human interaction; ultimately leading to a desired collaboration between people and
    machines in the context of real-world objectives.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Architect</span> - the common use of the term in the computing field has stripped
    this word of it's more noble dimensions. No longer is the architect "the person with the vision and skill to make
    dreams a reality". They are more likely to be the person in the corner who produces nothing but paper, leaves no
    fingerprints on the pages of history, and is generally ignored by those who are really making things happen.
  </li>
</ul><br>
<br>
I don't know what you should call the people who have the experience and ability to lead others to do amazing things
with the information technology we have at our disposal.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">I'm just pretty sure that "Software Architect" doesn't even come close to being
adequate. And building a "profession" around a woefully inadequate definition is a one-way ticket to irrelevance and
obscurity.</span>

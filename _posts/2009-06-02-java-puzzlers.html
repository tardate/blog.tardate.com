Apparently, Joshua Block and Neal Gafter started the "Java Puzzlers" idea at Oracle Open World 2001. I wish I
was there.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, they've turned it into a <a href=
"https://amzn.to/4kcsd2P" class="book-title">book</a>, and a <a href="http://javapuzzlers.com/">website</a>.<br>
<br>
If you program in Java, this is truly a must-read book.<br>

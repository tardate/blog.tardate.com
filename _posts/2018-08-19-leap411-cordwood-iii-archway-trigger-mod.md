This is the third Boldport Club project in the Cordwood series, and I've gone off-road
with a true 3D archway layout.
One thing lead to another, and soon I had a completely pointless LED blinking machine
spring-loaded LED trigger machanism.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<a href="https://amzn.to/3HYqKQk" class="book-title">Beginning Rails: From Novice to Professional</a>
by <a href=
"http://quotedprintable.com/">Jeffrey Hardy</a> and <a href="http://ccjr.name/">Cloves Carneiro</a> is one of
the most approachable "learning rails" books I have found to date.<br>
<br>
The writing is clear, and concepts are presented in a very readable way. I really appreciate the organisation
of the book - they've done a great job of presenting key topic areas in a logical sequence that guides you up
the learning curve without losing sight of the big picture.<br>
<br>
Working through the examples right now...<br>

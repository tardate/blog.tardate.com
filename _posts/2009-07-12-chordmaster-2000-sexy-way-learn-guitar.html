So <span style="font-style:italic;">this</span> weekend I've dressed up <a href="/2009/07/jtab-guitar-chord-and-tab-notation-for.html">jTab</a> as a little web application to help you learn chord fingerings for guitar...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Introducing the <span style="font-style:italic;">ChordMaster 2000</span> ;-)<br /></span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://chordmaster.tardate.com/"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 450px; " src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SllKNOdMC6I/AAAAAAAAAl4/LXWatPP36h0/s400/chordmaster2000.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357394822813191074" /></a><br /><br />OK, so maybe I sexed up the design and UI a little too much for such a simple task, but it was fun to see how far I could go with javascript and SVG (and no flash or silverlight).<br /><br />It was also a proof point for <a href="/2009/07/jtab-guitar-chord-and-tab-notation-for.html">jTab</a> - the javascript library I released last week that renders arbitrary guitar chord and tab using SVG. Happily, it worked fine without a tweak - just some extension methods that are specific to the ChordMaster application (like getting an array of all chords that are defined as "intermediate" level).<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">PS: big thanks to @jasonong who's jumped in and already made some great contributions to the jTab project on <a href="http://github.com/tardate/jtab/tree/master">github</a> -- It's amazing to see github rock as a "social coding" platform - create a public project one day, have changes to merge back the next. Trivial to do with git, and the great <a href="http://github.com/tardate/jtab/network">visualisation of the project revision/branch history</a> makes merging so easy to understand.</span>

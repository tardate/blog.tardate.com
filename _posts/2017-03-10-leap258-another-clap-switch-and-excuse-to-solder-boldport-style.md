I've had this clap-switch (voice activated) kit sculling around for a while .. another "stocking stuffer" bargain from aliexpress.
The circuit is very similar to a previous clap-switch project, and nothing drastically interesting.
So I pulled this kit out primarily to practice some Saar Drimer/Boldport-style soldering.
The objective is simply beautiful solder domes;-) I do some comparisons, and come to the realisation that
the solder stock is perhaps the most important factor.

I'm trying out some digital potentiometers for an application.
The M62429 is a dual channel electronic volume control so actually works on a log scale, but can be used for non-audio applicaitons.
The programming interface is a very simple two-wire (data, clock) serial protocol.
But being so simple (and having a strange command length of 11 bits) it's not really possible to use either
the standard Wire or SPI libraries. Time for some bit-banging!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

The original [Cordwood Puzzle](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/cordwood)
became an instant classic with club members, and the concept returns this year with a brand new puzzle.
The cordwoods evoke an era of stuffing massive components into small spaces. This is real hardware!
As before, it really is a puzzle, so if you don't want any spoilers - read no further.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<span style="font-style:italic;float:right;">OH on the ABC Radio National By Design podcast (00:56): <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bydesign/in-the-field----paul-bennet/4735498">In the field: Paul Bennet</a></span><br /><blockquote class="quote">For us the idea of small ideas that people can actually connect together and actually implement are very big ideas.<br /><br />And I'm sure you've heard people describe design thinking as sort of a combination of rocket science, string theory and calculus. <br /><br />It isn't. It's not rocket science at all. It's actually very very straight-forward. <br /><br /><b>It's looking in the world, being inspired by people, co-creating with them, prototyping and then iterating. And it has to be impactful. It has to work.</b><br /></blockquote>

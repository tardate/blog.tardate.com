I think I first heard about [LimeSDR-USB](https://wiki.myriadrf.org/LimeSDR-USB) on
[The Amp Hour](https://theamphour.com/314-an-interview-with-josh-lifton/).

I was convinced to jump in and give it a go particularly because
of the fully open-source nature of the platform - from hardware all the way to
software, including FPGA code.

The unit is suited to research and development in a wide range of areas,
but I suspect as I get more into this I will be mainly focused on areas such as
test and measurement (e.g. spectrum analysis) and amateur radio.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

There are some good video resource, a good place to start is: What is the LimeSDR?

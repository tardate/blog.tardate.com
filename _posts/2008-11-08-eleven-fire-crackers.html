        OK, plugging in my iPod now to drown out the friggin jingle bells playing in the background. It's barely
        November, I'm in Singapore ... so who invited Bing Crosby and a troop of reindeer godammit??<br>
        <br>
        Spinning thru albums at random I crank up the volume on <a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROAL44?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000ROAL44">

        border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">, and instantly remember why this was
        a 2 second buy decision back at some music store in Shinjuku.<br>
        <br>
        I picked it up while working in Tokyo a few years back. I was going crazy over the local bands, and this album
        by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellegarden">ELLEGARDEN</a> was kind of lost in all the great music at
        the time.

</table>I think I just listened to it about 3 times today. This is wild, energetic J-Rock at its best, a little pop and
heavy on the grunge. I guess what sets them apart from other bands in the genre - like <a href=
"http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/09/gwen-stefani-sweet-escape.html">Uplift Spice</a>, another of my favourites - is
that many songs are in English. Vocalist 細美武士 Takeshi Hosomi's accent is undefinable and intriguing. Could be Orange
Country one moment, pure cockney the next. A little like <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_(musician)">Hyde</a> in English.<br>
<br>
Having just rediscovered ELLEGARDEN, it's sad to now discover I am just a month late - they officially suspend their
activities indefinitely in September 2008 and go onto other things.<br>
<br>
So no chance to see them live anymore (at least as ELLEGARDEN), only go back and checkout their other albums. I can't
imagine anything better than <a href=

treasures to discover yet...<br>

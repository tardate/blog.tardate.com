OK, plugging in my iPod now to drown out the friggin jingle bells playing in the background. It's barely
November, I'm in Singapore ... so who invited Bing Crosby and a troop of reindeer godammit??<br>
<br>
Spinning thru albums at random I crank up the volume on <a href="https://amzn.to/4nfkXWq" class="book-title">Eleven Fire Crackers</a>,
and instantly remember why this was
a 2 second buy decision back at some music store in Shinjuku.<br>
<br>
I picked it up while working in Tokyo a few years back. I was going crazy over the local bands, and this album
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellegarden">ELLEGARDEN</a> was kind of lost in all the great music at
the time.

<br>
<br>
I think I just listened to it about 3 times today. This is wild, energetic J-Rock at its best, a little pop and
heavy on the grunge. I guess what sets them apart from other bands in the genre - like <a href=
"/2007/09/gwen-stefani-sweet-escape.html">Uplift Spice</a>, another of my favourites - is
that many songs are in English. Vocalist 細美武士 Takeshi Hosomi's accent is undefinable and intriguing. Could be Orange
Country one moment, pure cockney the next. A little like <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_(musician)">Hyde</a> in English.<br>
<br>
Having just rediscovered ELLEGARDEN, it's sad to now discover I am just a month late - they officially suspend their
activities indefinitely in September 2008 and go onto other things.<br>
<br>
So no chance to see them live anymore (at least as ELLEGARDEN), only go back and checkout their other albums. I can't
imagine anything better than
<a href="https://amzn.to/4nfkXWq" class="book-title">Eleven Fire Crackers</a>. But maybe I have some
treasures to discover yet...<br>

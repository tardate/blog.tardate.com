<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">OK, plugging in my iPod now to drown out the friggin jingle bells playing in the background. It's barely November, I'm in Singapore ... so who invited Bing Crosby and a troop of reindeer godammit??<br /><br />Spinning thru albums at random I crank up the volume on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROAL44?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ROAL44">Eleven Fire Crackers</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000ROAL44" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and instantly remember why this was a 2 second buy decision back at some music store in Shinjuku.  <br /><br />I picked it up while working in Tokyo a few years back. I was going crazy over the local bands, and this album by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellegarden">ELLEGARDEN</a> was kind of lost in all the great music at the time.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000ROAL44&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>I think I just listened to it about 3 times today. This is wild, energetic J-Rock at its best, a little pop and heavy on the grunge. I guess what sets them apart from other bands in the genre - like <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/09/gwen-stefani-sweet-escape.html">Uplift Spice</a>, another of my favourites - is that many songs are in English. Vocalist 細美武士 Takeshi Hosomi's accent is undefinable and intriguing. Could be Orange Country one moment, pure cockney the next. A little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_(musician)">Hyde</a> in English. <br /><br />Having just rediscovered ELLEGARDEN, it's sad to now discover I am just a month late - they officially suspend their activities indefinitely in September 2008 and go onto other things.<br /><br />So no chance to see them live anymore (at least as ELLEGARDEN), only go back and checkout their other albums. I can't imagine anything better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROAL44?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ROAL44">Eleven Fire Crackers</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000ROAL44" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. But maybe I have some treasures to discover yet...<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ybQRZMO8R6k&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ybQRZMO8R6k&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

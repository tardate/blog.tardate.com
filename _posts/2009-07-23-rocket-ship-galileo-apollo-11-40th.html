The 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing has been getting <a href=
"http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/07/apollo-11s-40th-anniversary-goes-anything-but-unnoticed.ars">quite
a bit of coverage</a>, but the coolest initiative has got to be the addition of the <a href=

<br>
Quite coincidentally, I just read Robert A. Heinlein's <a href=
"https://amzn.to/44nitgf">
"Rocket Ship Galileo"</a> (well, actually listened to the audio
version brilliantly narrated by Spider Robinson ).

Heinlein packs this atomic moonshot adventure with just about every Boy's Own plot twist possible and tells a
rollicking ripping yarn. What's amazing is the detail of the hard science throughout the book - especially given the
fact it was written in 1947.<br>
<br>
All the <span style="font-style:italic;">shucks, gee willikins</span> is quaintly pre-baby boom, while the embracing of
atomic power with such wild abandon is frightening in retrospect. Altogether, it's a great - if dated - story; a true
testament to Heinlein's genius and imagination.<br>
<br>
On atomics: it is possible the tide of opinion may be swinging back to nuclear. The ABC Science show just featured a
story on the safer and cheaper generations of reactors coming online (<a href=
"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2629053.htm">transcript</a>, <a href=
"http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2009/07/ssw_20090718_1205.mp3">audio</a>). Today's <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_III_reactor">generation III</a> reactors, and the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor">generation IV</a> on the horizon offer even cheaper, safer and
cleaner power (literally eating the waste products of earlier designs). All well and good, but it would be a concern if
"new atomics" became the quick and easy fix that sabotages the head of steam building up behind the true <span style=
"font-style:italic;">clean, green renewables</span> (like <a href="http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=11568.php">solar
nanopillars</a>).<br>

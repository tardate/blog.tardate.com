The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscious_competence">conscious competence</a> learning model has uncertain origins, but is probably the best known model for learning. Maybe that's because it is so simple and intuitive - I suspect making it exactly the right kind of 'model' to be picked up by the business book and management consulting fraternity.<br /><br />It seems to me best applied to the development of "skills" (like riding a bike or programming in python), and less so to changing bahaviour or habits (like giving up smoking).<br /><br />But for skills it works really well, and the simple 2x2 matrix of conscious-competence yields lots of interesting observations to ponder.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SLQEI0DkZ_I/AAAAAAAAAY4/8gTXWDHe-EE/s1600-h/learning-model.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SLQEI0DkZ_I/AAAAAAAAAY4/8gTXWDHe-EE/s400/learning-model.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238816815997806578" /></a><br />That's my version of the matrix. I re-label the "conscious" axis as either "self-conscious" (as in you are painfully aware that you can't do something), or "automatic" (where you have reached the stage where performance is reflexive).<br /><br />Where you start, where you get to, and the path you take are really dependent on the situation and the individual. In the picture above, I've indicated a starting point of where you are self-conscious about the fact you can't do something; although the literature talks about the strict theoretical starting point of being totally unaware you can't do something (automatic - cannot do in the diagram).<br /><br />So anything interesting to note?<br /><ul><li>Progressing from knowing you can't do something to <span style="font-style:italic;">thinking</span> you can (the redish line above) is, I think, a perfect defintion of what we call "blur like sotong" in Singapore</li><br /><li>How straight-line your pregession towards automatic-can do is probably a good guide of "natural ability"</li><br /><li>Learning (or training, education and guided practice) tends to shift you up the scale of competence only - since it is more about giving you the knowledge and techniques to do the job 'right'</li><br /><li>Experience (or practice with reflection) tends to move you up the conscious scale towards the point where it is automatic.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />So is this model of any practical use? As a point of reflection on your own, or your collegues situation, I think it can be a good but crude diagnostic. It makes you remember things like just plain training needs to be coupled with real experience to get you all the way up the curve.

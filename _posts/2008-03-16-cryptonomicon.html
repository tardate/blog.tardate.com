I've had my head in <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson's</a>
<a href="https://amzn.to/44FcuUj" class="book-title">Cryptonomicon</a>
for the past few weeks. Seriously, at a thousand-over pages, its not one to knock over in an evening.<br>
<br>
But it is a fantastic tale. Actually more like three tales in one.<br>
<br>
It makes me wonder how he does it. The writing is like stream of consciousness, and I guess it would need to be
judging how prolific he is (I haven't even started on the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle">baroque cycle</a>). Yet if mere mortals like you or I would
try this, I am pretty sure the result would be pure tripe.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Cryptonomicon</span> is anything but.<br>
<br>
I am dazzled and intrigued by the miscellaneous tangential twists and turns of the narrative, and the
incredibly inventive detail that scatter the way, like breadcrumbs leading to a safe haven.<br>
<br>
Little things such as his similes.

<br>
And subtle digs that flit by if you are not paying attention.<br>

        I've had my head in <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson's</a> <span style=
        "font-weight:bold;"><a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060512806?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060512806">

        width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></span> for the
        past few weeks. Seriously, at a thousand-over pages, its not one to knock over in an evening.<br>
        <br>
        But it is a fantastic tale. Actually more like three tales in one.<br>
        <br>
        It makes me wonder how he does it. The writing is like stream of consciousness, and I guess it would need to be
        judging how prolific he is (I haven't even started on the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle">baroque cycle</a>). Yet if mere mortals like you or I would
        try this, I am pretty sure the result would be pure tripe.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Cryptonomicon</span> is anything but.<br>
        <br>
        I am dazzled and intrigued by the miscellaneous tangential twists and turns of the narrative, and the
        incredibly inventive detail that scatter the way, like breadcrumbs leading to a safe haven.<br>
        <br>
        Little things such as his similes.

        </blockquote>Now isn't that brilliant? Surely deserves a named place in the <a href=
        "http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colornames.asp">CSS Color Palette</a> if I were the judge!<br>
        <br>
        And subtle digs that flit by if you are not paying attention.<br>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          "You know what that is? It's one of those men-are-from-venus, women-are-from-mars things"<br>
          "I have not heard this phrase but I understand immediately what you are saying."<br>
          "It's one of those American books where once you've heard the title you don't even need to read it," Randy
          says.
        </blockquote>Oh so true.<br>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          "Then I won't."
        </blockquote>Priceless!<br>

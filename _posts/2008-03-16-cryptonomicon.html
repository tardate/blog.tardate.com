Seriously, at a thousand-over pages, its not one to knock over in an evening.<br /><br />But it is a fantastic tale. Actually more like three tales in one. <br /><br />It makes me wonder how he does it. The writing is like stream of consciousness, and I guess it would need to be judging how prolific he is (I haven't even started on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle">baroque cycle</a>). Yet if mere mortals like you or I would try this, I am pretty sure the result would be pure tripe.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cryptonomicon</span> is anything but. <br /><br />I am dazzled and intrigued by the miscellaneous tangential twists and turns of the narrative, and the incredibly inventive detail that scatter the way, like breadcrumbs leading to a safe haven.<br /><br />Little things such as his similes.<blockquote class="quote">.. dead-monitor-screen grey..</blockquote>Now isn't that brilliant? Surely deserves a named place in the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colornames.asp">CSS Color Palette</a> if I were the judge!<br /><br />And subtle digs that flit by if you are not paying attention.<br /><blockquote class="quote">"You know what that is?

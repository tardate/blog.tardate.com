I hinted at a project to develop a simple filter add-in in my last post on <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2008/01/code-generation-with-jdeveloper.html">Code Generation with JDeveloper</a>. So that turned into my latest weekend project;-)<br /><br />I'm registering the project on sourceforge, but in the meantime you can get the full source kit <a href="http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master/tardate.jdev.ide.filter.10.1.3-src.zip?raw=true">here</a>, or if you prefer just the add-in jar <a href="http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master/tardate.jdev.ide.filter.10.1.3.jar?raw=true">here</a> (which just needs to be dropped into your <span class="code">${jdev.home}/jdev/extensions</span> folder). <em>[30-Jan-2008: the project is now available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdevfilter/">sourceforge</a>]</em><br /><br /><strong>What does it do?</strong><br />It is a simple idea. Allow you to invoke an external program to <em>filter</em> any text you have selected in the JDeveloper Editor. Of course, it is up to you to define what <em>filter</em> means - limited by your imagination only. And by externalizing the filter process, it means you can use the tool or scripting language of your choice to implement and make on-the-fly changes to your filter.<br /><br />To be precise, the filter operates like operating system pipes:<ul><li>Selected text is sent to the standard-input of the filter process.</li><li>The standard-output of the filter process is written back to replace the selected text.</li></ul> <br /><strong>Configuring the Filter</strong><br />Configuration is done via the JDeveloper <em>Tools | Preferences</em> menu, and is very simple at present. It only supports a single filter process definition. As you can see in the screenshot, you just need to enter a valid command line to invoke the filter. <em>A nice enhancement would be the support for multiple filter definitions.</em><br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wkA7igFfI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/pgBdfueP8lg/s1600-h/jdevfilter-preferences.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wkA7igFfI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/pgBdfueP8lg/s400/jdevfilter-preferences.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160038871460746738" /></a><br />This is where the flexibility comes in. As an example, I've provided a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">rot13</a> encoder written in ruby [<span class="code">samples/myrot13filter.rb</span> in the source kit].<br /><blockquote class="code">puts $stdin.readlines.to_s.tr("A-Za-z", "N-ZA-Mn-za-m")</blockquote> <br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wkIbigFgI/AAAAAAAAAOY/HZQgrwgRDkk/s1600-h/jdevfilter-apply.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wkIbigFgI/AAAAAAAAAOY/HZQgrwgRDkk/s400/jdevfilter-apply.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160039000309765634" /></a>Ruby, Perl, php, vbscript/WSH, bash ... use whatever you prefer. Rather than needing to develop and deploy an add-in in Java, you can just script the filter.<br /> <br />Applying the filter is simply a matter of selecting some text in the IDE, and choose the <em>Custom Text Filter</em> item from the right-click pop-up menu<br /><br /><strong>The Development View</strong><br />The truth is that I developed this add-in as more an investigation of the Extensions SDK, and the filter idea appeared to be unexplored territory.<br /><br />As <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/duffblog/2007/07/26#a461">Brian Duff writes</a>, there are some major improvements in the support for JDeveloper Extensions in 11g. Since it is still in preview, I decided to stick with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/esdk/api1013/index.html">Extension SDK 10.1.3</a> however.<br /><br />There are four classes of significance. since this was an educational exercise, I spent a bit of time to make sure I really understood how it all worked, and tried to reflect that with liberal comments in the source.<br /><ul><li><strong>CodePaneAddin </strong>- implements the pop-up menu hook and applies the filter</li><li><strong>ExecShell </strong>- wraps the invocation of the filter process iwth stdin/out handling. It is independent of the extension API and may be of interest in its own right</li><li><strong>ConfigPanelData </strong>- handles preferences panel configuration</li><li><strong>ConfigData </strong>- bean to wrap the configuration data</li></ul><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wklLigFhI/AAAAAAAAAOg/PIq0p3m8Pzw/s1600-h/jdevfilter-classes.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R5wklLigFhI/AAAAAAAAAOg/PIq0p3m8Pzw/s400/jdevfilter-classes.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160039494231004690" /></a><br />The <a href="http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master/tardate.jdev.ide.filter.10.1.3-src.zip?raw=true">source kit</a> comes with a JDeveloper project and also ant build file. If you want to build and deploy the add-in to JDeveloper, simplest is to first check the environment-specific settings in <span class="code">build.properties</span> and then simply run<br /><blockquote class="code">C:\MyDocs\MyDev2\JDevFilter>ant deploy<br />Buildfile: build.xml<br /><br />init:<br /><br />prepare:<br /><br />compile:<br /><br />jar:<br /><br />deploy:<br />     [copy] Copying 1 file to C:\oracle\jdevstudio10131\jdev\extensions<br /><br />BUILD SUCCESSFUL<br />Total time: 0 seconds</blockquote><br />Interested? Head on over to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdevfilter/">sourceforge</a> to download the kit.

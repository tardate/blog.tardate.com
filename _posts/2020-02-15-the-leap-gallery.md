From the start, every project in the [Little Electronics & Arduino Projects (LEAP)][leap]
collection has included at least one *hero image* as part of the documentation.

So feeling lazy and in the mood for some un-challenging fiddling, I decided to put them in a gallery.
It's perhaps not very useful as a visual navigation tool, but at least I find it interesting
to look at the patterns.

The transition from green cutting board to wood tones corresponds with about when I discovered the
[Boldport Club](https://boldport.com/club)
and started to think of my hobby as more art than science.
Not that it has turned me into a photographic genius,
but at least now I think twice about lighting and background before snapping away!

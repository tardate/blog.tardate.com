After testing <a href="/2005/12/running-axis-with-oracle-oc4j.html">AXIS</a> , I quickly moved on to check the latest
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon 2.1.8</a> release. I'd tried getting earlier versions running with OC4J but
given up due to the xerces, xalan and jdk certification mix - it was hell. Fortunately Cocoon 2.1.8 worked (almost)
perfectly first time with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/oc4j/">Oracle Application Server
Containers for J2EE 10g (10.1.2.0)</a>.<br>
<br>
After building Cocoon, I simply used a manual installation with the standalone version, which simply required
$ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/home/config/application.xml and $ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/home/config/http-web-site.xml to include the Cocoon
webapp.<br>
<br>
The only "fixup" required - and this is for a non-fatal SAX processing error - is to force Cocoon to use the XML
parsers etc that are included in the Cocoon distribution instead of the default (Oracle) parsers included in the OC4J
distribution. The fix is to force "search-local-classes-first. To do this edit
$ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/home/application-deployments/&lt;your Cocoon deployment path&gt;/orion-web.xml. Uncomment the
line:<br>
<span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">&lt;web-app-class-loader search-local-classes-first="true"
include-war-manifest-class-path="true" /&gt;</span>

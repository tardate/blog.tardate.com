<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I've been lax in my little posts about books I've read. One of the reasons is that I'm now addicted to <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/pratalife/books">bookjetty</a>, which makes it sooo easy to track my reading and think "I'll review/blog it later". The other reason is simply time.<br /><br />But reading Jim Longuski's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387308768?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0387308768">The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0387308768" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />has prompted me into action again.<br /><br />This is a great book on practical innovation, and generally just getting things done. Although it takes the "Rocket Scientist" as the model (understandable, since Longuski is one), it largely avoids the trap of being elitist and sycophantic. It's just an honest and thoughtful analysis of how rocket scientists work, and presented almost like a pattern language for knowledge workers.<br /><br />The "seven secrets" are actually seven stages of the creative process, from the initial idea generation through to delivery. Each stage includes half a dozen or more "secrets" (or patterns), so the book is more like "The 50 Secrets of How to .."<br /><ul><li>Dream</li><br /><li>Judge</li><br /><li>Ask</li><br /><li>Check</li><br /><li>Simplify</li><br /><li>Optimize</li><br /><li>Do</li></ul></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0387308768&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>The book is also littered with great quotes, has a bibliography that immediately adds many books to your "must read" list. Perhaps the best part is however Longuski's ladder of the <span style="font-style:italic;">"Greatest Sci-Fi Films of the Twentieth Century"</span> gratuitously included in the appendix. Longuski clearly has some <span style="font-style:italic;">"issues"</span> with Shuttle-era NASA, but when these intrude on the text, they just serve to highten the drama!<br /><blockquote class="quote">Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent.

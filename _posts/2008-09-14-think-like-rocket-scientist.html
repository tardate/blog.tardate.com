        I've been lax in my little posts about books I've read. One of the reasons is that I'm now addicted to <a href=
        "http://www.bookjetty.com/people/pratalife/books">bookjetty</a>, which makes it sooo easy to track my reading
        and think "I'll review/blog it later". The other reason is simply time.<br>
        <br>
        But reading Jim Longuski's <a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387308768?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0387308768">
        The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist</a><img src=
        "https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0387308768" width="1" height="1"
        border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">has prompted me into action again.<br>
        <br>
        This is a great book on practical innovation, and generally just getting things done. Although it takes the
        "Rocket Scientist" as the model (understandable, since Longuski is one), it largely avoids the trap of being
        elitist and sycophantic. It's just an honest and thoughtful analysis of how rocket scientists work, and
        presented almost like a pattern language for knowledge workers.<br>
        <br>
        The "seven secrets" are actually seven stages of the creative process, from the initial idea generation through
        to delivery. Each stage includes half a dozen or more "secrets" (or patterns), so the book is more like "The 50
        Secrets of How to .."<br>

</table>The book is also littered with great quotes, has a bibliography that immediately adds many books to your "must
read" list. Perhaps the best part is however Longuski's ladder of the <span style="font-style:italic;">"Greatest Sci-Fi
Films of the Twentieth Century"</span> gratuitously included in the appendix. Longuski clearly has some <span style=
"font-style:italic;">"issues"</span> with Shuttle-era NASA, but when these intrude on the text, they just serve to
highten the drama!<br>

I recently had cause to install and configure the Oracle Instant Client under Linux. As I've written before, it is a breeze to get a client up and running.<br /><br />I did find however that the way the instant client deploys its files can break makefiles and so on if you are doing C/C++ development.<br /><br />I wrote a simple script (see <a href="http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master/installInstantClient.sh?raw=true">installInstantClient.sh</a>) to install and cleanup an Instant Client and take care of a few things like:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>move executables into a /bin subdirectory<br /></li><li>move libraries into a /lib subdirectory<br /></li><li>create links for commonly know library names<br /></li><li>create a default network/admin/tnsnames.ora<br /></li><li>suggest appropriate environment settings for your .bash_profile<br /></li></ul><br /><br />Note that the script is written to explicitly handle the basic+sdk+sqlplus installation. If you want to use it for a different combination of kits it will need some simple modification.

I was pretty amazed to see <a href="http://www.os2world.com/content/view/16595/1/">IBM responding as recently as 16-Jan-2008</a> to the requests by the <a href="http://www.os2world.com">OS/2 online community</a> to open source OS/2.<br /><br />I've <a href="/2007/05/top-10-dead-or-dying-computer-skills.html">admitted before</a> to being an OS/2 fanatic for a few years, but seriously, I think we should let it die and just savour the memories!<br /><br />One of the great things about the OS/2 community way-back-when is that it was a total geek-out (<em>memories of the OS/2 Devcon in 1992 - still have the bag tag!</em>). Linux has I think long taken that mantle.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R56XhbigFiI/AAAAAAAAAOo/DzbWeI1KBqo/s1600-h/os2-tag.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R56XhbigFiI/AAAAAAAAAOo/DzbWeI1KBqo/s400/os2-tag.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160728823597110818" /></a><br /><br />It's a bit of a laugh to find some of my OS/2 detritus still kicking around the Internet, like:<ul><br /><li>My article in EDM/2: <a href="http://www.edm2.com/0303/rexx.html">REXX - The Developer's Best Friend</a></li><li>A few tools still up in the os2 collection at <a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&dir=/pub/os2">hobbes</a>:</li><ul><li><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/wp/xeol11.zip">xeol</a> for text file format conversion</li><li>A Workplace Shell <a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/wps/css10.zip">Command Shell Starter</a></li><li><a href="http://garbo.uwasa.fi/pub/pc/util/inised10.zip">INISED</a> - a utility to manipulate Windows-style profile (INI) files</li><li><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/archiver/varc10b3.zip">varc</a> - Visual archive utility front-end, requires VREXX</li><li><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/disk/dsize10.zip">dsize</a> - Display file/directory space usage on drives (REXX)</li><li><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/disk/shlong10.zip">shlong</a> - Lists non-FAT names on an HPFS drive (REXX)</li></ul><li>.. mostly developed using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REXX">REXX</a> or my favourite compiler of the time: <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BORLAND+SHIPS+BORLAND+C%2B%2B+2.0+FOR+OS+2%3B+New+Version+Includes+OWL...-a016001527">Borland C++ for OS/2</a>!</li></ul><br />I had fun with a couple of other projects that never made it to release (in both cases beaten to the post by the big boys. But dang it, no M&A windfalls in those days!):<ul><li>LNDW - Lotus Notes Doorway. I wrote a web server in C++ that provided gateway access to Lotus Notes database under OS/2. Tricky adaptation of the Notes C API to C++ and getting it to work with BC++. Then came Domino...</li><li>OS2IP - a project with a long-lost collegue Bryan Ryan <em>(if you are out there Bryan - drop me a line!)</em>. At the time, there was no free TCP/IP stack for OS/2 Warp, so we set about writing one. Got as far as an NDIS packet driver, and a user mode frame interface before IBM finally got their act together and made us obsolete! Nevertheless, good fun hacking around with the Driver Dev Kit in assembler, and bridging to a C++ user-mode API. I don't think it was until then that I really understood <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131876716?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0131876716">Comer</a> in detail. When you are working at that level, it is amazing how exciting exchanging just a few bytes of data in a chat application can be!</li></ul>

I first heard about MicroPython from the [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214379695/micro-python-python-for-microcontrollers)
campaign to open source the software.

Although it makes more sense to use it with a more capable board, I'm starting with a test on a 512kb ESP-01 module.

Nice ... python on a micro, running Star Wars ascimation!

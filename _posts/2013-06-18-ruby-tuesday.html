<span style="font-style:italic;float:right;">(blogarhythm ~ <a href="http://youtu.be/TWcUSa-f5dE">Ruby - Kaiser
Chiefs</a>)</span><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/a_matsuda">@a_matsuda</a> convinced us to dive into Ruby 2.0 at <a href=
"http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/">RedDotRubyConf</a>, so I guess this must be the perfect day of the week for it!<br>
<br>
Ruby 2.0.0 is currently at <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/05/14/ruby-2-0-0-p195-is-released/">p195</a>,
and we heard at the conference <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/a_matsuda/ruby-2-dot-0-on-rails-in-production">how
stable and compatible it is</a>.<br>
<br>
One change we learned that may catch us if we do much multilingual work that's not already unicode is the change that
Ruby now assumes UTF-8 encoding for source files. So the special "encoding: utf-8" marker becomes redundant, but if we
don't include it the behaviour in 2.0.0 can differ from earlier versions:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ cat encoding_binary.rb <br>s = "\xE3\x81\x82"<br>p str: s, size: s.size<br>$ ruby -v encoding_binary.rb <br>ruby 2.0.0p195 (2013-05-14 revision 40734) [x86_64-darwin11.4.2]<br>{:str=&gt;"„ÅÇ", :size=&gt;1}<br>$ ruby -v encoding_binary.rb <br>ruby 1.9.3p429 (2013-05-15 revision 40747) [x86_64-darwin11.4.2]<br>{:str=&gt;"\xE3\x81\x82", :size=&gt;3}<br>
</pre><br>
<h3>
  Quickstart on MacOSX with RVM
</h3>I use <a href="https://rvm.io/">rvm</a> to help manage various Ruby installs on my Mac, and trying out new
releases is exactly the time you want it's assistance to prevent screwing up your machine. There were only two main
things I needed to take care of to get Ruby 2 installed and running smoothly:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Update rvm so it knows about the latest Ruby releases
  </li>
  <li>Update my OpenSSL installation (it seems 1.0.1e is required although I haven't found that specifically documented
  anywhere)
  </li>
</ol>Here's a rundown of the procedure I used in case it helps (note, I am running MacOSX 10.7.5 with Xcode 4.6.2).
First I updated rvm and attempted to install 2.0.0:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ rvm get stable<br># =&gt; updated ok<br>$ rvm install ruby-2.0.0<br>Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.<br>No binary rubies available for: osx/10.7/x86_64/ruby-2.0.0-p195.<br>Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm mount' to get more information on binary rubies.<br>Installing requirements for osx, might require sudo password.<br>-bash: /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1e/bin/openssl: No such file or directory<br>Updating certificates in ''.<br>mkdir: : No such file or directory<br>Password:<br>mkdir: : No such file or directory<br>Can not create directory '' for certificates.
</pre>Not good!!! What's all that about? Turns out to be just a very clumsy way of telling me I don't have OpenSSL
1.0.1e installed.<br>
<br>
I already have OpenSSL 1.0.1c installed using brew (so it doesn't mess with the MacOSX system-installed OpenSSL), so
updating is simply:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ brew upgrade openssl<br>==&gt; Summary<br> /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1e: 429 files, 15M, built in 5.0 minutes
</pre>So then I can try the Ruby 2 install again, starting with the "rvm requirements" command to first make sure all
pre-requisites are installed:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ rvm requirements<br>Installing requirements for osx, might require sudo password.<br>[...]<br>Tapped 41 formula<br>Installing required packages: apple-gcc42.................<br>Updating certificates in '/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem'.<br>$ rvm install ruby-2.0.0<br>Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.<br>No binary rubies available for: osx/10.7/x86_64/ruby-2.0.0-p195.<br>Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm mount' to get more information on binary rubies.<br>Installing requirements for osx, might require sudo password.<br>Certificates in '/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem' already are up to date.<br>Installing Ruby from source to: /Users/paulgallagher/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195, this may take a while depending on your cpu(s)<br>[...]<br>$ 
</pre>OK, this time it installed cleanly as I can quickly verify:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0<br>$ ruby -v<br>ruby 2.0.0p195 (2013-05-14 revision 40734) [x86_64-darwin11.4.2]<br>$ irb -r openssl<br>2.0.0p195 :001 &gt; OpenSSL::VERSION<br> =&gt; "1.1.0"<br>2.0.0p195 :002 &gt; OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION<br> =&gt; "OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013"
</pre>

Adam Keys and Geoffrey Grosenbach introduced the term for 2008 on the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/geoffrey-grosenbach">rails podcast</a>: <span style="font-style:italic;">show the whale</span>.<br />I think it's perfect, and in my lexicon already!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SJSHfCw3iBI/AAAAAAAAAYw/wdKoWOe5PkI/s1600-h/showthewhale.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SJSHfCw3iBI/AAAAAAAAAYw/wdKoWOe5PkI/s400/showthewhale.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5229954034671519762" /></a>==> No, this is not the official fail whale logo! The real one was done by <a href="http://www.yiyinglu.com/sc/illustration">Yiying Lu</a>, a young designer from China/Sydney, who now is world famous thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a>'s stability problems.

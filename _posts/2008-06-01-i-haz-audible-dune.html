As a long time <a href="https://twit.tv">TWiT</a> listener, and a fan of audiobooks, I've long been tantalised by one of the TWiT network's biggest sponsors - <a href="https://audible.com/twit">audible</a>.<br /><br />To my chagrin, last I checked - admittedly a long time ago - I was unable to subscribe to audible because I live in Singapore. Undoubtedly due to pre-Copernican copyright issues.<br /><br />After chatting with a colleague from the US the other day who was raving about audible, I thought I'd try again.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Success!</span> I am over the moon to now be a totally addicted audible member (it seems 99% of titles are available for purchase to me - just a few that are restricted due to copyright).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Dune-Audiobook/B002V1OF70?productID=BK_AREN_000620"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 95px;" src="/assets/2008-06-01-i-haz-audible-dune/audible_dune_full_image.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>With my free credit (for signing up as a TWiT listener) I bought the unabridged adaptation of Frank Herbert's <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Dune-Audiobook/B002V1OF70?productID=BK_AREN_000620">Dune</a>. The production by Audio Renaissance is truly wonderful. The selected use of character actors, and subtle atmospheric music and sound effects really bring the story to life, keeping you enthralled for the full 21 hours.<br /><br />It is many years since I last read and re-read Dune, and it was great to rediscover the book in audio. Still the SF classic I remember, and now I have it sitting in my audible library for another listen in the not too distant future.<br />

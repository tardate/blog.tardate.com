It is amazing to see the art of the rich internet application (RIA) rocketing ahead over the past year or so, after a slow and troubled gestation over the past 12 years or so. Much of the progress has been incremental and focused on technical reimplementation of old non-web concepts (think event handling in a form GUI). Sometimes we take a big leap forward (think rails, prototype).<br /><br /><a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> arguably kicked of the current phase of web applications with <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">basecamp</a> that finally allow us to forget we are working in a browser (or was it writely? - now <a href="http://docs.google.com/">google docs</a>).<br /><br />Now we are seeing a selection of frameworks or products specifically designed for building modern RIAs. Rails is of course now fairly established in this space, but products like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Air</a>, <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator</a> and <a href="http://www.wavemaker.com/">WaveMaker</a> are redefining the envelope.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Well I'll be bold enough to say now that I think the guys from 280North have just redefined the cutting edge again with their powerpoint/keynote killer called <a href="http://280slides.com">280Slides</a></span>. <br /><br />It's just out in public beta (isn't everything?), but I challenge you not to be impressed with just how much like a great piece of desktop software it is ... except you've also got the power of web access, sharing and delivery.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SF_MbpkrzkI/AAAAAAAAAXM/fvcmNZ04DFI/s1600-h/280slides.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SF_MbpkrzkI/AAAAAAAAAXM/fvcmNZ04DFI/s400/280slides.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215111668906577474" /></a><br />Perhaps even more impressive is the story behind the app, which you can hear in an interview on <a href="http://twit.tv/natn57">net@nite #57</a>. When these guys set out to write web applications (like 280slides), they wanted a real development environment - like <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">cocoa</a> which they were familiar with having worked at Apple. So they built a cocoa-compatible/Objective-C like platform that runs in pure javascript. That's what is running 280slides, but building it is like building any old cocoa app. NB: the platform is still being kept internal, but their intention is to go open source when it is ready for the wild.<br /><br />280North have only recently gone public with 280slides and the platform they have been building. Interesting to see at the same time we have Apple announcing a more conventional javascript library <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a>. Can anyone spell a-c-q-u-i-s-i-t-i-o-n&nbsp;&nbsp;t-a-r-g-e-t?<br /><br />Exciting times!

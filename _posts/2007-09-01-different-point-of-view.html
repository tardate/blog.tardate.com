        The Jedi are terrorists, and the Star Wars saga just pulp propaganda undermining the Empire's sworn duty to
        protect peace and prosperity through the galaxy. Regular citizens just want to get on with life, but will the
        rebels let them? Hell no!<br>
        <br>
        <em>That</em> is a different point of view;-)<br>
        <br>
        This podcast series, presented from the point of view of standtrooper TD-0013, is a classic. If you've seen the
        Star Wars movies, prepare to be shocked into realising that Lucas just got totally sucked in by flimsy lies of
        the Rebel Alliance.<br>

        I found this at <a href="https://scribl.com/books/PB7EB/a-different-point-of-view">podiobooks [now scribl]</a>
        where you can subscribe to the series RSS feed for your iPod or whatever, or checkout the <a href=
        "https://web.archive.org/web/20120415203932/http://www.adpov.net/">author's site (now archived)</a>. Highly
        recommended if you grew up with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.<br>

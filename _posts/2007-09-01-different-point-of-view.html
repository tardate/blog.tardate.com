<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">The Jedi are terrorists, and the Star Wars saga just pulp propaganda undermining the Empire's sworn duty to protect peace and prosperity through the galaxy. Regular citizens just want to get on with life, but will the rebels let them? Hell no!<br /><br /><em>That</em> is a different point of view;-)<br /><br />This podcast series, presented from the point of view of standtrooper TD-0013, is a classic. If you've seen the Star Wars movies, prepare to be shocked into realising that Lucas just got totally sucked in by flimsy lies of the Rebel Alliance.<br /><br />I found this at <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/a-different-point-of-view/">podiobooks</a> where you can subscribe to the series RSS feed for your iPod or whatever, or checkout the <a href="http://adpov.net/">author's site</a>. Highly recommended if you grew up with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/a-different-point-of-view/"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 144px;" src="http://www.podiobooks.com/images/covers/adpov_podiobook02.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table>

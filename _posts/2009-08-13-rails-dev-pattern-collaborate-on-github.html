Heroku is an awesome no-fuss hosting service for rails applications (I think I've <a href=
"/2008/07/heroku-ruby-in-sky-with-diamonds.html">raved about it enough</a>).<br>
<br>
It works great for solo development. But what if you want a large team work on the app, while limiting production
deployment privileges? Or if you want the application to run as an open source project?<br>
<br>
Since git is core infrastructure for heroku, it actually makes setting up distributed source control trivial, like in
the diagram:<br>
<br>
<a href=

Here's a simple pattern for setting up this way. It may fall into the special category of "the bleeding obvious" if you
are an experienced git user. But many of us aren't;-)<br>
<br>
First, I'm assuming you have a rails application in a local git repository to start with. Like this:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ rails test<br>$ cd test<br>$ git init<br>$ git add .<br>$ git commit -m "initial check-in"
</pre><br>
Next, you want to create a <a href="http://github.com/repositories/new">new, empty repository on github</a>. Github
will give you a clone URL for the new repo, like<br>
"git@github.com:mygitname/test.git".<br>
<br>
Now we can add the github repo as a new remote location, allowing us to push/pull from github. I'm going to name the
destination "github":<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ git remote add github git@github.com:mygitname/test.git<br>$ git push github master<br>Enter passphrase for key '/home/myhome/Security/ssh/id_rsa':<br>Counting objects: 3, done.<br>Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 209 bytes, done.<br>Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)<br>To git@github.com:mygitname/test.git<br> * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
</pre><br>
At this point, you are setup to work locally and also collaborate with other's via github. If you have a paid account
on github, you can make this a private/secure collaboration, otherwise it will be open to all.<br>
<br>
Next, we want to add the application to heroku. I'm assuming you are already registered on heroku and have the <a href=
"/2009/06/running-heroku-on-windows.html">heroku gem setup</a>. Creating the heroku app is a one-liner:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ heroku create test<br>Created http://test.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:test.git<br>Git remote heroku added<br>$ 
</pre><br>
You can see that this has added a new remote called "heroku", to which I can now push my app:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
$ git push heroku master<br>Enter passphrase for key '/home/myhome/Security/ssh/id_rsa':<br>Counting objects: 29, done.<br>Delta compression using up to 2 threads.<br>Compressing objects: 100% (17/17), done.<br>Writing objects: 100% (17/17), 2.17 KiB, done.<br>Total 17 (delta 12), reused 0 (delta 0)<br><br>-----&gt; Heroku receiving push<br>-----&gt; Rails app detected<br>       Compiled slug size is 208K<br>-----&gt; Launching....... done<br>       http://test.heroku.com deployed to Heroku<br><br>To git@heroku.com:test.git<br>   4429990..4975a77  master -&gt; master
</pre><br>
<br>
So we are done! I can push/pull from the remote "github" to update the master source collection, and I can push/pull to
the remote "heroku" to control what is deployed in production.<br>
<br>
Sweet!<br>
<br>
PS: Once you are comfortable with this, you might want to get a bit more sophisticated with branching between
environments. Thomas Balthazar's "<a href=
"http://suitmymind.com/blog/2009/06/02/deploying-multiple-environments-on-heroku-while-still-hosting-code-on-github/">Deploying
multiple environments on Heroku (while still hosting code on Github)</a>" is a good post to help.

For some reason, there's a common fixation on making computers take on a character and actually talk to us. Like
another human. Or dog, seal or animated sponge....<br>
<br>
Why? Can't think of any deeper reason than its just a bit of fun.<br>
<br>
The state of the art is not quite Toy Story, but its certainly come a long way. I remember playing with (now defunct?)
<a href="http://javaboutique.internet.com/javahead/">JavaHead</a> a few years back: impressive demo, but it was hard
work to get good results with your own images. You needed to be a techie/animator/audio engineer.<br>
<br>
I've just been playing with <a href="http://www.pqdvd.com/talkingphoto/blogit2.html">PQ Talking Photo</a>, and it's
great to see not only a pretty good, synchronised animation but also a great, anyone-can-do-it UI. My little test is
below, hopefully earning me a promo copy by blogging about it. <em>Shameless!</em><br>

I've just released an update to <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/authors/id/P/PA/PAULPG/tree-sync">tree-sync-2.2.pl</a> on
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/CPAN/Administrative/index.html">CPAN</a>. This fixes a few bugs with special
character handling in filenames.<br>
<br>
I've currently three main uses for the script:<br>
<ul>
  <li>On my Windows XP laptop, I use it to backup my working files to an external drive. For this I use the "fwdonly"
  mode so that the external drive copy is a perfect copy of what I have on the laptop.
  </li>
  <li>Also on my laptop, I have a collection of files that I sync with the external drive in "full" sync mode
  (default). This means changes will be exchanged bidirectionally. This is useful because sometimes I will drop files
  into this area with the external drive connected to another machine.
  </li>
  <li>Thirdly, I use it on my server to sync a collection of files from cvs into a web-visible area.
  </li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style:italic;">PS: As of Oct-2008, the tree-sync project is now on <a href=
"http://github.com/tardate/tree-sync">github</a>. Use this if you want to contribute to development. Of course,
releases will still be distributed for use on <a href=
"http://www.cpan.org/scripts/CPAN/Administrative/index.html">CPAN</a>.</span>

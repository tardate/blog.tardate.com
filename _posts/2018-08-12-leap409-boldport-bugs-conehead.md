Conocephalus is a genus of bush-crickets, known as coneheads.
Now I have one beautifully rendered in a 3D kit from Boldport.
It even has a pretty convincing FM-synthesised chirp that varies in response to lighting conditions.

Boldport projects never fail to inspire some new learning. In the case it introduced me to
[Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) - a nifty open source visual programming language for multimedia.
I reproduced the Pure Data chirp model and added a few more controls to make it easier to play around with.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

I was <span style="font-style:italic;">so-o</span> tempted to buy one <a href=
"https://blog.tardate.com/2010/07/yokoso-tokyo">in Japan last week</a>, so I'm happy that <a href=
"http://bit.ly/af6nHV">TODAY reports</a> the Apple iPad will go on sale here in Singapore on Friday (23rd Jul 2010,
with iPhone 4 expected on the 30th).<br>
<br>
The biggest surprise for me was that it's only selling through Apple and authorised resellers. None of the local telcos
will be offering it directly at this point.<br>
<br>
Now, I definitely prefer not to have an operator or service provider involved in any of my device purchases, but I'd
still be intrigued to know the inside story (<span style="font-style:italic;">Apple asking too much? Apple not
interested in a deal for such a small market? Telcos don't see any real benefit without exclusivity?</span> TODAY - go
investigate and report on that, not just the pricing press release maybe?)<br>
<br>
Secondly, and not so surprising: the pricing is real nice. Probably one of the lowest worldwide, and not encumbered by
contracts.<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  The WiFi-only models will retail for $728, $878 and $1,028 for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models, respectively. iPads
  with WiFi and 3G connectivity will retail for $928, $1,078 and $1,228 for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models,
  respectively.
</blockquote>I was in Japan last week and checked out the iPad (of course). <span style="font-weight:bold;">I now know
it's true: once you touch it you must have it.</span> It is just so responsive and smooth to use, and the size and
weight are just right for casual browsing and apps.<br>
<br>
Remember the <a href=
"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-video/7777042/iPad-queues-in-Japan-nearly-1km-long.html">reports of
1km queues for the iPad in Japan back in May?</a>. Well, now of course you just walk in and there are more demo units
and helpful sales people than customers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style:italic;">btw, I don't know where all the Japanese iPads went .. traveling all over Tokyo for a
week and I only saw one being used in the wild (and the owner appeared to be American), with everyone else still glued
to their flip phones. I wonder if it's just not private enough to be used on crowded public transport?</span><br>
<br>
I didn't have the SG prices at the time, but as a general rule Singapore tends to be cheaper for tech. I [just barely]
managed to resist temptation, and it turned out the right bet - at least from a financial standpoint.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Now I can go queue for an iPad in Singapore;-)</span><br>
&lt;brain style="state:on;fanboy:off;"&gt;..or maybe just wait a few more days&lt;/brain&gt;<br>

I was <span style="font-style:italic;">so-o</span> tempted to buy one <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2010/07/yokoso-tokyo.html">in Japan last week</a>, so I'm happy that <a href="http://bit.ly/af6nHV">TODAY reports</a> the Apple iPad will go on sale here in Singapore on Friday (23rd Jul 2010, with iPhone 4 expected on the 30th).<br /><br />The biggest surprise for me was that it's only selling through Apple and authorised resellers. None of the local telcos will be offering it directly at this point. <br /><br />Now, I definitely prefer not to have an operator or service provider involved in any of my device purchases, but I'd still be intrigued to know the inside story (<span style="font-style:italic;">Apple asking too much? Apple not interested in a deal for such a small market? Telcos don't see any real benefit without exclusivity?</span> TODAY - go investigate and report on that, not just the pricing press release maybe?)<br /><br />Secondly, and not so surprising: the pricing is real nice. Probably one of the lowest worldwide, and not encumbered by contracts.<br /><blockquote class="quote">The WiFi-only models will retail for $728, $878 and $1,028 for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models, respectively. iPads with WiFi and 3G connectivity will retail for $928, $1,078 and $1,228 for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models, respectively.</blockquote>I was in Japan last week and checked out the iPad (of course). <span style="font-weight:bold;">I now know it's true: once you touch it you must have it.</span> It is just so responsive and smooth to use, and the size and weight are just right for casual browsing and apps. <br /><br />Remember the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-video/7777042/iPad-queues-in-Japan-nearly-1km-long.html">reports of 1km queues for the iPad in Japan back in May?</a>. Well, now of course you just walk in and there are more demo units and helpful sales people than customers. <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">btw, I don't know where all the Japanese iPads went .. traveling all over Tokyo for a week and I only saw one being used in the wild (and the owner appeared to be American), with everyone else still glued to their flip phones. I wonder if it's just not private enough to be used on crowded public transport?</span><br /><br />I didn't have the SG prices at the time, but as a general rule Singapore tends to be cheaper for tech. I [just barely] managed to resist temptation, and it turned out the right bet - at least from a financial standpoint. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Now I can go queue for an iPad in Singapore;-)</span><br />&lt;brain style="state:on;fanboy:off;"&gt;..or maybe just wait a few more days&lt;/brain&gt; <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEVAU-dwszI/AAAAAAAABy0/tjOmCn8dPZU/s1600/iPad+in+Shinjuku.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 308px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEVAU-dwszI/AAAAAAAABy0/tjOmCn8dPZU/s400/iPad+in+Shinjuku.jpg" border="0" title="Softbank iPad sales in Shinjuku" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5495869649384944434" /></a><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blogarhythm for this post: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LWVGS4?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003LWVGS4">Bachelor Pad - Fantastic Plastic Machine</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003LWVGS4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></span>

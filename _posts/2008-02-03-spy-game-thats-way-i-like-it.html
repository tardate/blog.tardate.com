Just started watching
<a href="https://amzn.to/44mwJ97" class="book-title">Spy Game</a>
and got a surprise to see <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Pang">Adrian Pang</a> playing a minor role.<br>
<br>
He's a pretty big celeb in Singapore, mainly as a funny guy but also done his share of drama. Probably best
know for co-hosting Yummy King (好吃王) with Michelle Chia.<br>
<br>
But by far the best thing I've seen him do is a little-know movie called
https://amzn.to/44cLniT
<a href="https://amzn.to/44mwJ97" class="book-title">That's The Way I Like It</a>
. It's an hilarious transposition of
<a href="https://amzn.to/4efLG12" class="book-title">Saturday Night Fever</a>
into a Singaporean context. Get it if you can (found at <a href=
"http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+7315+3002+10164930+18+3">Library@Esplanade</a> if you
live in Singapore). Here's a teaser:

  Disco hits Singapore. Hock, an ordinary underachiever, discovers disco when his favorite kung fu movie is
  replaced by a low-budget "Saturday night fever."

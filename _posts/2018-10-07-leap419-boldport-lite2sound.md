The Boldport Lite2Sound BC is a crafty collaboration with [Rare Waves LLC](http://rarewaves.net/).
It uses a photodiode to detect audio-frequencies from light, which are amplified and piped to an audio jack (or optionally to direct line-out).

Best of all - it comes in an Altoids-sized can!

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

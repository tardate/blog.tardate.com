I announced <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2009/07/jtab-guitar-chord-and-tab-notation-for.html">jTab</a> back in July, and there have been some nice improvements over the past month which I just tagged as a "1.1" release.<br /><br />jTab is a javascript-based library that allows you to easily render arbitrary guitar chord and tabulature (tab) notation on the web. Automatically. It is open source (<a href="http://github.com/tardate/jtab/tree/master">available on github</a>).<br /><br />I've also established a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jtab">mailing list for jTab</a>. All are welcome to join in to discuss internal development issues, usage, and ideas for enhancement.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SlB2ZghZZbI/AAAAAAAAAlw/UBu5YpQTMGk/s1600-h/jtab-example.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 99px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SlB2ZghZZbI/AAAAAAAAAlw/UBu5YpQTMGk/s400/jtab-example.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5354910137542337970" /></a> <br />Some of the key new features:<br /><ol><br /><li>All chords can be represented in any position on the fretboard e.g. Cm7 Cm7:3 Cm7:6</li><br /><li>Now allows shorthand tab entry of 6-string chords e.g. X02220 (A chord at nut), 8.10.10.9.8.8 (C chord at the 8th fret)</li><br /><li>jTab diagrams now inherit foreground and background color of the enclosing HTML element</li><br /><li>When entering single-string tab, can reference strings by number (1-6) or by note in standard tuning (EAGDBe)</li><br /><li>The chord library with fingerings has been extended to cover pretty much all common - and uncommon - chord variants (m, 6, m6, 69, 7, m7, maj7, 7b5, 7#5, m7b5, 7b9, 9, m9, maj9, add9, 13, sus2, sus4, dim, dim7, aug).</li><br /><li>It has been integrated with TiddlyWiki: <a href="http://jtab.tardate.com/jtabtwiki-help.htm">jTabTwiki</a> combines the guitar chord and tab notation power of jTab with the very popular TiddlyWiki single-file wiki software. Together, they allow you to instantly setup a personal guitar tab wiki/notebook. No kidding. And it's free.</li><br /></ol>

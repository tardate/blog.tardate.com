The
[LRAS1130](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRAS1130) Arduino library from @luckyresistor
is an easy way to get started with the BoldportClub Matrix and an Arduino.
I'm using a slightly modified version of the LedTest sketch from the library here.
LED test = all passing!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

tree-sync.pl has had a little update thanks to a contribution from Dave Stafford.<br /><ul><li>Added option 'diff' to view only changes </li><br /><li>Added option 'ignore' to exclude certain extensions</li><br /><li>Added option 'brief' to remove src/dest directories in report view to make cleaner output</li></ul><br />In the 2.4 release I've also added the 'force' option to control read-only file handling.<br /><br />tree-sync.pl is a bit of a geeky tool, suitable for cases where you want detailed control over a file-based copy/mirror/backup process from the command-line. There are many flashier solutions available these days, but if tree-sync scratches your itch - go for it!<br /><br /><a href="http://cpan.perl.org/authors/id/P/PA/PAULPG/tree-sync/tree-sync-2.4.pl">tree-sync.pl</a> continues to be available on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/CPAN/Administrative/index.html">CPAN</a>, but from the 2.4 release I have moved the source to <a href="http://github.com/tardate/tree-sync">github</a>.

This week its my pleasure to host Log Buffer #54, the Carnival of the Vanities for DBAs. Thanks to Dave Edwards at
<a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs">Pythian</a> for the invite to put this together. <em>Dave must be a very chilled
sorta guy to be able to survive each Friday, not knowing what on earth his guest editor is going to churn
out!!</em><br>
<br>
Of course 11g continues to be a big topic this week.<br>
<br>
Dan Norris adds his views on the <a href=
"http://www.dannorris.com/2007/07/13/the-best-oracle-database-11g-new-features/">best 11g new features</a> to the
flurry that came out last week. Christian Bilien's having a party to celebrate <a href=
"http://christianbilien.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/hooray-for-the-11g-asm-%e2%80%9cfast%e2%80%9d-mirror-resync-at-last/">ASM
fast mirror resync</a>. Syed Jaffar Hussain discovers the alert log <a href=
"http://jaffardba.blogspot.com/2007/07/alertlog-file-in-11g.html">will now be XML</a>. Personally I shudder; still not
convinced that XML is appropriate for log files.<br>
<br>
It strikes me that in this period between launch and <em>release</em>, there's more eyeballs on docs that at any other
time in the product lifecycle;)<br>
<br>
<em>NB: There still seems to be <a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2007/07/12/when-is-oracle-11g-released/">some
confusion</a> whether we are meant to know when 11g will arrive or not. Steven Chan's older post <a href=
"http://blogs.oracle.com/schan/2007/03/20#a1303"><em>almost</em> convinced me</a> there's a good reason why we don't
hear dates;)</em><br>
<br>
In the SQL Server world, Kalen Delaney blogs in wonderment having discovered the <a href=
"http://sqlblog.com/blogs/kalen_delaney/archive/2007/07/17/did-you-know-nobody-upgraded-the-set-options-screen-in-sql-server-management-studio.aspx">
dialog box that time forgot</a>. And Bob Beauchemin has some good SQL Server <a href=
"http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/bobb/2007/07/17/SomeBookReviews.aspx">book reviews</a>.<br>
<br>
While on book reviews, Stewart Smith is <a href=
"http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2007/07/13/backup-and-recovery-the-book/">impressed by O'Reilly's Backup &amp;
Recovery</a> because it covers just about every way to back up and recover systems (I trust not <a href=
"http://oracledoug.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1288-Sigh.html">this way</a>).<br>
<br>
So did PostgreSQL trounce Oracle or not? Kevin Closson <a href=
"http://kevinclosson.wordpress.com/2007/07/18/application-server-benchmark-proves-postgresql-is-the-best-enterprise-database-server-new-specjappserver2004-cost-metric-introduced-too/">
exposed the lazy reporting</a> that seems to have sparked this "non-story". But you know how pointless it is to try and
correct the facts <a href="http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9746829-16.html">once they are out on the net</a>, right?
Its a pity for the controversy, because as <a href=
"http://www.jpipes.com/index.php?/archives/181-Congrats-to-the-PostgreSQLEnterpriseDBSun-Team-for-Benchmarks.html">Jay
Pipes writes</a>, the benchmark achievement is no mean feat for the PG dev team.<br>
<br>
Lots of interseting stuff on mysql this week. Mats Kindahl takes mysql proxy for a <a href=
"http://mysqlmusings.blogspot.com/2007/07/musings-on-mysql-proxy.html">decent test drive</a>, concludes it has great
potential and offers some constructive comments on gaps to be filled. The <a href=
"http://marksitblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/mysql-5-high-availability-with-drbd-8.html">MySQL 5 HA with DRDB and
Heartbeat</a> guide is very well put together by Mark Schoonover (who blurs the line between blog post and technical
reference guide!)<br>
<br>
What do I like most about open source? Take something like Jay Pipes <a href=
"http://www.jpipes.com/index.php?/archives/182-Internals-of-MyISAMs-Concurrent-Insert-Functionality-Part-I.html">internals
of MyISAM Concurrent insert</a> (part 1 posted this week). Great example of hard core geek writings. Can you ever
imagine Oracle, IBM or Microsoft getting down and dirty on internals like this? I love it!<br>
<br>
Moving on to deeper thoughts...<br>
<br>
K. Brian Kelley mulls over <a href=
"http://blogs.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/brian_kelley/archive/2007/07/16/2703.aspx">what it means to be a dba</a>, but
might be surprised that Patrick Wolf stumbled across an 11g feature that means <a href=
"http://inside-apex.blogspot.com/2007/07/oracle-11g-native-web-services.html">DBA's may put Java/SOA guys out of
work</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Doug Burns</a> ponders just <a href=
"http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1296-fork-2.html">how many blogs a person should have</a>, and
in the process gave quite a few pause for thought.<br>
<br>
Over in the <a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/categoryHome.jspa?categoryID=84">Oracle Forums</a>, activity seems
to be at a high but one wonders about the signal to noise. I think Sidhu was <a href=
"http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=1961644&amp;tstart=0#1961644">remarkably restrained</a> when I
think my response may just have been jfgi!<br>
<br>
... and that's pretty much a wrap for this week. Thanks for reading my first attempt at editing the Log Buffer. It just
remains for me to leave you with my lame attempt at a bit of 11g humour. Keep on blogging!<br>

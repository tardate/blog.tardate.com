The Cordwood has six LEDs. Six is one of my favourite numbers .. like the number of strings on a standard guitar.
Here's a quick build that uses an electret pre-amp and a simple Arduino script to provide a pretty stable and accurate indication of
which root note is playing.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

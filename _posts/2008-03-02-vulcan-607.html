<a href="https://amzn.to/44lqJ09" class="book-title">Vulcan 607</a>
is the story of the incredible raid
on Stanley airfield by the RAF's aging V-Force that signaled the start of the 'shooting war' with Argentina
over the Falkland Islands. This was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Black_Buck">Operation
Black Buck</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Rowland White</span> does a very good job of telling the story in immense
detail, giving equal weight to the technicalities and personalities involved.<br>
<br>
It's a rollicking read, especially if you enjoy reading the real stories behind military history. And the point
is well made: considering the age of the Vulcan bombers and supporting Victor air-air tankers, the distances
involved it is amazing that Vulcan 607 managed to take out the Stanley runway on the first flight. To put the
single Vulcan 607 on target, it took: 1 <a href=

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor">Victors</a>, 40 take-offs and landings, 42 1000lb bombs, 90
aircrew.

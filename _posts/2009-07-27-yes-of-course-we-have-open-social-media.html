<blockquote class="quote">We embrace openness and customer engagement using the latest social media tools such as twitter, facebook and blogs*<br /><br />* subject to prior approval, review, certain topic restrictions and we reserve the right to change our mind, terminating your network or your employment, now or at any time in the future. Have a nice day. </blockquote><br /><a href="http://www.tomfishburne.com">Tom Fishburne</a> perfectly captures the reality of how many big companies really work. This may be painfully funny, but sadly I don't think it's all fiction...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.tomfishburne.com/tomfishburne/2009/07/corporate-twitter.html"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 450px; height: 341px;" src="http://www.tomfishburne.com/.a/6a00e008c4515188340115712413db970c-800wi" border="0" alt="" /></a>

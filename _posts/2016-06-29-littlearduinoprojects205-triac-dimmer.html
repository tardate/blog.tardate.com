A triac is a "bidirectional thyristor" because it conducts in both directions and is typically used in AC applications.<br /><br />The basic behaviour of a triac can be summarised in two rules:<br /><ul><li>Rule 1. To turn ON, a gate current ≥ IGT must be applied until the load current is ≥ IL (latching current).</li><li>Rule 2. To turn OFF (commutate), the load current must be < IH (holding current) for long enough for the device to return to the blocking state.</li><br /></ul>This project is a test of the classic AC dimmer circuit with Triacs with a 12V AC supply. It allows power to be dialed down by effectively chopping out part of each cycle.

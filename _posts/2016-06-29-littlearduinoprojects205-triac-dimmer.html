A triac is a "bidirectional thyristor" because it conducts in both directions and is typically used in AC
applications.<br>
<br>
The basic behaviour of a triac can be summarised in two rules:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Rule 1. To turn ON, a gate current ≥ IGT must be applied until the load current is ≥ IL (latching current).
  </li>
  <li>Rule 2. To turn OFF (commutate), the load current must be &lt; IH (holding current) for long enough for the
  device to return to the blocking state.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>This project is a test of the classic AC dimmer circuit with Triacs with a 12V AC supply. It allows power to be
dialed down by effectively chopping out part of each cycle. As always, <a href=

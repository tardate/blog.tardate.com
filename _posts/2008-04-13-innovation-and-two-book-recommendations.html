There's a great quote in <a href="http://chadfowler.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chad
Fowler's</span></a> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZMGyM5" class="book-title">My Job Went to India</a>
which I just posted a <a href="/2008/04/my-job-went-to-india-and-all-i-got-was.html">quick review</a> of:<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  In business, ideas are dime a dozen. It's the blood, sweat, tears and money you pour into a product that make
  it really worth something.
</blockquote>I'd extend that and link it to a later part of the book that focuses on <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Execution</span>.<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  To be successful, raw ability will get you only so far. The final stretch is populated by closers - people
  who finish things.
</blockquote>As Theodore Levitt said:
<blockquote class="quote">
  Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things.
</blockquote>In other words, the key is <span style="font-style:italic;">doing</span>. One of my pet
subjects;-) I can come up with a million creative ideas, but without follow-through, its all just a bit of
mental fun.<br>
<br>
An excellent companion read is Scott Berkun's <a href=
"/2007/11/myths-of-innovation.html">The Myths of Innovation</a>.<br>
<br>
Get them both on your bookshelf! The sooner, the better.

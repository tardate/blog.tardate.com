<a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> is a very interesting lightweight middleware framework for language-neutral, cross-platform RPC.<br /><br />When I heard about Natalie Silvanovich's <a href="http://natashenka.ca/hardware-excuse-generator/">Hardware Excuse Generator</a> on <a href="http://embedded.fm/episodes/111">Embedded.fm</a>, I immediately recognised a better "Hello World" for testing out gRPC.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleCodingKata/tree/master/messaging/grpc/explainer">Introducing "The Explainer"</a>: my programming exercise to learn basic cross-language request/reply with gRPC.<br /><br />I haven't completed the whole matrix of client-server possibilities yet, but here's a sampling... <br /><br />Start up a server (e.g ruby version)<br /><pre name="code" class="shell:wraplines:nocontrols">$ ./explainer.rb <br />ShiFu is waiting to explain all of your problems...<br /></pre><br />And then ask it questions. Pick a language!<br /><pre name="code" ><br /># Ruby client<br />$ ./explain.rb "Your phone is crashing because of REASON" <br />Your phone is crashing because of the <br />PCB not being manufactured to specification<br /><br /># C# client<br />$ mono bin/Release/explain.exe "Your phone is crashing because of REASON"<br />Your phone is probably crashing because of stray harmonics<br /><br /># C++ client<br />$ ./explain "Your phone is crashing because of REASON"<br />Your phone is crashing because of impedance in the coil<br /><br /># node.js client<br />$ node ./explain.js "Your phone is crashing because of REASON"<br />Your phone is crashing because of a lack of shielding against <br />alpha radiation (cosmic rays) in antenna<br /><br /># Python client<br />$ python explain.py "Your phone is crashing because of REASON"<br />Your phone is crashing because of residual capacitance <br />caused by the USB connector<br /></pre><br />All my notes and code are <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleCodingKata/tree/master/messaging/grpc/explainer">available in the LittleCodingKata GitHub repository</a>.

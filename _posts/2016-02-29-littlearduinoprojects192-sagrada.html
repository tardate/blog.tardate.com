The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família</a> has been under construction since 1882. The magnitude of the vision driving the project - both physically and creatively - is striking, especially at first hand.<br /><br />Then you see the work in progress - the cranes, scaffolding, workers scurrying around the site. But that is what I think really brings it to life. This is not a frozen, finished statement of something other-worldy. It's a vibrant expression of the hope and aspirations of a whole bunch of people working together.<br /><br />In other words, it is the ultimate maker project! Personally, I think it will be a sad day when someone declares it actually "finished".<br /><br />Now at the extreme other end of the maker-scale is this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFO3MIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HFO3MIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=UUSQ6CYPF5HQIMLK">neat little paper nano Sagrada Familia kit</a> that I picked up in my travels.<br /><br />I've "electrified" it to some extent with some <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/LowVoltageGlowingLEDs">LowVoltageGlowingLEDs</a> that animate the background, just running off a 1.5V supply. Although I think I could have slowed down the LEDs even further.<br /><br />A nice effect I think..<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFkUJQybjwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Kraft/SagradaFamilia">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br />

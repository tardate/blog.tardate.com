Hmm, mounted a Windows 2000 FAT32 partition under linux, but I find that any 8.3 name that is all uppercase on windows
is appearing as all lowercase under Linux. Mixed case names are handled properly. Not a major issue until you try and
do something like point gcvs at a cvs repository on the vfat partition .. and it can't find the "CVSROOT" directory
(since it appreas as "cvsroot").<br>
There are some references on the web that indicate the "check=s" vfat mount option might help, but that does not do the
trick for me. A bit of testing later, and what I can report is that the "shortname=winnt" is what is needed. For
example:<br>
<code>[root@home #] mount -t vfat -o ro,shortname=winnt /dev/hda1 /mnt/win2k<br>
[root@home #] ls -l /mnt/win2k/MyCVS<br>
total 56<br>
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 8192 Jun 5 2003 CVSROOT<br>
drwxr-xr-x 11 root root 8192 Sep 6 2003 MyConfig<br>
drwxr-xr-x 35 root root 8192 Jun 5 2003 MyDev<br>
drwxr-xr-x 26 root root 8192 Oct 9 2003 Testers<br></code><br>

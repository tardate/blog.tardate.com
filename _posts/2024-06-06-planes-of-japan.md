[The Planes of Imperial Japan](https://planes-of-imperial-japan.tardate.com/)
is a little project I made while waiting for a plane at Haneda Airport back in 2023.

I wanted a way to quickly lookup Japanese planes from the second world war and
get a basic summary with pictures and links to more information
.. including a link to [scalemates](https://www.scalemates.com/) if you are looking for scale models;-)

Sources are available on GitHub, click through for more information..

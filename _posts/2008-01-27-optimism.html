<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had quite a bit to say about optimism.<br /><blockquote class="quote">A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.</blockquote><blockquote class="quote">For myself I am an optimist. It does not seem to be much use being anything else.</blockquote>But <a href="http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/havelock.htm">Havelock Ellis</a> would rather lock him up.. <br /><blockquote class="quote">The place where optimism most flourishes is the lunatic asylum.</blockquote>

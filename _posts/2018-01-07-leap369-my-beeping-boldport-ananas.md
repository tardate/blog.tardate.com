Boldport Club Project #20 is the first designed by Ben, the new Boldporter. And it's a beauty!

As is often the case, and small but interesting circuit is at the core of a beautiful design.
The circuit is essentially four repetitions of an RC phase-shift oscillator.
Like other projects such as the famous Cordwood series, the design employs multi-board symmetry and 3D construction.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

I see AJAX popping up in discussions ever more frequently these days, an apparent groundswell around the next great
thing for solving the perennial issue of delivering a rich client experience over the web. So far I've just been
reading and listening. As with all new acronyms, it takes a while to figure out just exacly what the hell its all
about. My "Ahah!" moment came after reading an article at <a href=
"http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AdaptivePath</a>.<br>
I must admit it seems AJAX is more a pattern than a specification, and its by no means clear that AJAX is anything more
that a fad. It's not hard to find some interesting and contrary points of view on the web - <a href=

Anyway, after all that reading, I'm itching to at least go for a test drive. Have to have some playtime soon ... and
after listening to <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/audio/podcast-webdevradio-2005-11-29-13361.mp3">this webdevradio
podcast</a>, I think I may start out with a look at <a href="http://www.fudnik.com">phAtJAX</a>.

<a href="http://reddotrubyconf.com/">RedDotRubyConf 2011</a> in Singapore is over. It was an amazing event (<a href="http://twitter.com/ryanbigg">ryan</a> takes notes so we don't have to - <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/reddot-day-one">day#1</a> <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/reddot-day-two">day#2</a>) <br /><br />Somehow I managed to cheat my way into a line-up of legendary speakers that included Matz himself.

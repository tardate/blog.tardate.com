The [dazaro3](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5ca_ymxbKi9GqVH7BMxbg) Youtube channel has some of the simplest and most practical FM transmitter circuits around, with a bonus that he actually shows them working.
I first experimented with his
[three-stage transmitter on a breadboard (LEAP#280)](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/FM/BreadboardTransmitter)
and got such good results that I then put it in an Altoids can, and finally bought a legit one from dazaro
as a benchmark and a bit of payback for sharing such great designs.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

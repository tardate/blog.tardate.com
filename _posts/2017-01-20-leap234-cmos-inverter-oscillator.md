I found this oscillator circuit used in the
[LEAP#182 PowerSupply317Kit](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PowerSupply317Kit).
It is another variation of the basic Schmitt Inverter Waveform Generator pattern, which I tested in
[LEAP#022 SchmittOscillator](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/SchmittOscillator).
But performance ... is quite terrible actually. Oscillation is only sustained for a small sweep of the 100kÎ© pot.
The waveform is also heavily asymmetric - with a duty cycle at most 25%.

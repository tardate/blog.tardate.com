After reading <a href="http://web.mac.com/guywalters/Site/Home.html">Guy Walters</a>'
<a href="/2007/11/colditz-legacy.html">The Colditz Legacy</a>, I picked up
<a href="https://amzn.to/44vW6Gx" class="book-title">The Leader</a>.<br>
<br>
The book plays out a convincing and chilling alternative history of the rise and fall of fascism in pre-WWII
era Britain. The fork in the road from actual history is the refusal of King George to adbicate over his
marriage to Mrs Simpson and the resulting face-off with Parliament that allows "The (fascist) Leader" to fill
the power vacuum. The book presents a thought-provoking study of just how easy it could be for any society to
head down the same path as Germany under Hitler. And the further you go, the harder it is to retreat without
drastic action.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/44vW6Gx" class="book-title">The Leader</a>
kept me engaged to the very last word. Definitely worth a read.<br>

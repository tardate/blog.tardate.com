Switches are the most basic of input devices for electrical and electronic systems.
Thorough coverage of the variety of switches can be found in works such as
Charles Platt's excellent [Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17017467-encyclopedia-of-electronic-components-volume-1),
and John M. Hughes' [Practical Electronics: Components and Techniques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21483234-practical-electronics).
[These are my notes on nomenclature and specific components - available in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

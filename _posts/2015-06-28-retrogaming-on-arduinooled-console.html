<span style="font-style:italic;float:right;">(blogarhythm ~ <a href="https://youtu.be/gTw2YvutJRA">invaders must die - The Prodigy</a>)</span>  <br />Tiny 128x64 monochrome OLED screens are cheap and easy to come by, and quite popular for adding visual display to a microcontroller project.<br /><br />My <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/playground/OLED/SSD1306BareBack">first experiments</a> in driving them with raw SPI commands had me feeling distinctly old school, as the last time remember programming a bitmap screen display was probably about 30 years ago!<br /><br />So while in a retro mood, what better than to attempt an arcade classic? At first I wasn't sure it was going to be possible to make a playable game due to the limited Arduino memory and relative slow screen communication protocol.<br /><br />But after a few tweaks of the low-level SPI implementation, I was surprised myself at how well it can run. Even had enough clock cycles left to throw in a sound track and effects.<br /><br />Here's a quick video on YouTube of the latest version. <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/playground/OLED/ArdWinVaders">ArdWinVaders</a>! .. in full lo-rez monochrome glory, packed into 14kb and speeding along at 8MHz.  <br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/playground/OLED/ArdWinVaders">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBX0n_YXXcs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Full source and schematics are in the <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects">LittleArduinoProjects collection on Github</a>.

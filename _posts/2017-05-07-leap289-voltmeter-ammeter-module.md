This combined voltmeter-ammeter panel-mount module is a decent unit if you don't need more precision than ±0.1V/±0.01A.
It did take a bit of reverse-engineering and experimentation to get it calibrated, but once done the accuracy
stays true within 1% over the full range.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<a href="https://amzn.to/3HYstFi" class="book-title">The Best Software Writing I</a>
.. it's a pity that there was never a volume II for this classic collection of the best software writing, selected
and introduced by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a>.<br>
<br>
I just picked it up to re-read some of my favourites, like
<ul>
  <li>Bruce Eckel's <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0025">Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing</a>, which
  is a bit of a milestone article in the rise of the "scripting" languages like ruby and Python.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Adam Bosworth's <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">ICSOC04 Talk</a> which reminds
  us it is more important for computer science to be understandable by people than by computers.<br>
  </li>
</ul><br>
There's also some great pointed humour, with
<ul>
  <li>Rory Blyth's <a href="http://napoleon.com/blog/posts/434.aspx">Excel as a Database</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000931">Powerpoint Remix</a> - Aaron Swartz<br>
  </li>
  <li>And the legendary <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-3.html">A Quick (and Hopefully Painless)
  Ride Through Ruby (with Cartoon Foxes)</a> by why the lucky stiff<br>
  </li>
</ul><br>
Definitely one of the all-time-must-have tech reads (and re-reads).<br>

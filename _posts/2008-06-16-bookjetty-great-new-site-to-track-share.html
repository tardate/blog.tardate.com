<img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 130px;" src="/assets/2008-06-16-bookjetty-great-new-site-to-track-share/logo_bookjetty.gif" border="0" alt="" />I've fallen in love with <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com">bookjetty</a>, a great new site for books by <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/jugend">Herryanto Siatono</a>.  <br /><br />Although this blog is officially dedicated to prata (and always will be!), you can tell I use it to keep a diary of the books I'm reading. I probably always will, but I do try out all the "book tracking" sites, facebook apps and so on that I come across. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">None have really jiggled my worm until I discovered <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/">bookjetty</a>.</span><br /><br />The <span style="font-weight:bold;">killer feature</span> for me is the great library integration on the site. It helps answer all the usual questions I have whenever I hear about a new book..<br /><ul><br /><li>Have I already got it or read it before?</li><br /><li>Does one of my friends have it? <span style="font-style:italic;">Maybe I can borrow it..</span></li><br /><li>Can I get it from the local library?</li><br /><li>Can I buy it online?</li><br /><li><span style="font-style:italic;">(oh, and if the last two steps fail, I may actually visit a real bookstore!)</span></li><br /></ul>The library catalogue checks work a treat - right within your booklist. I used this feature yesterday as I knew I would be heading to the library. Within 5 minutes on bookjetty I had added a few books I'd been interested in reading and found out that 3 of them were available and on the shelf at my local library. An hour later, I had them checked out.<br /><br />The bookjetty developer(s?) have done a great job of integrating the libraries, especially considering that most are still running archaic web 0.1 systems which are not very mashup friendly. I've posted before about a <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2008/02/quick-nlb-catalogue-lookups.html">kludge</a> to do library lookups from an amazon page, but it never works very reliably because of the dumb library catalogue it needs to talk to, so I can appreciate some of the challenges they may have had.<br /><br />And here's an example of how the library checks appear... <br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/assets/2008-06-16-bookjetty-great-new-site-to-track-share/bookjetty.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212425550192645794" /><br />If you are into books, I heartily recommend you go and register at <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com">bookjetty</a> and check it out!

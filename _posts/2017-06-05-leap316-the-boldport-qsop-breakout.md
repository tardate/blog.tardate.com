The QSOPBreakout was a special (read: beautiful!) board produced for the Boldport Club to help members
practice QSOP-24 soldering techniques for the Touchy project.
Firstly, I'm using this project to collate my notes on solder technique.
And secondly, perhaps there is something useful I can do with the QSOPBreakout board after all .. other than use it as a breakout board of course. And it turns out there is .. see the [SolarPendulum](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/QSOPBreakout/SolarPendulum)!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

The control terminal of the 555 timer can be used to adjust the upper and lower thresholds with an applied voltage.
This produces a very simple voltage-controlled oscillator.
The few measurements I've taken show that control adjustments have as much impact on duty cycle as frequency.
That may be what you want ... or not!

I was kindly invited by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a> to review Yuli Vasiliev's new
book
<a href="https://amzn.to/3HYdomR" class="book-title">SOA and WS-BPEL</a>.
The review copy just arrived today in time for a quick scan.<br>
<br>
I'm immediately drawn by the fact that this is one book that clearly goes beyond smarchitectural blurgh and
gets down to concrete details. The focus is on showing how you can create solutions with an open source or
freely available toolset - specifically <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> and <a href=
"http://www.active-endpoints.com/">ActiveBPEL</a>. And when it comes the database of course you expect <a href=
"http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a>, but I am very pleased to see that Yuli also gives full coverage of using
(freely available) <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/index.html">Oracle Database
XE</a>.<br>
<br>
Looks like a few days of fun ahead as I work through the book in more detail. I'll be sure to post my review
when I'm done.<br>

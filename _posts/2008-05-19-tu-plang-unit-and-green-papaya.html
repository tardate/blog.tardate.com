I've had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitator">Regurgitator's</a>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3FTPE2T" class="book-title">Tu-Plang</a> and
<a href="https://amzn.to/4njoSS7" class="book-title">Unit</a>
since when I was working
in Sydney around 98/99. These albums are classics. I love their sound, and the lyrics are smart. They still get
a regular listen, and that's not going to stop.<br>
<br>
In a twist, I saw recently on the <a href=
"https://www20.sbs.com.au/foodlovers/index.php?seriesID=3&amp;episodeID=14">Food Lover's Guide to Australia</a>
that Quan's mother established a Vietnamese restaurant in Brisbane called Green Papaya, and it has great
reviews.<br>

<blockquote class="quote">
  It was Hanoi-born Lien Yeomans's dream come true - opening her own restaurant. At Brisbane's Green Papaya she
  cooks dishes from North Vietnam. She says she has her rock star son Quan to thank for her fame (he’s with the
  band Regurgitator) but we think it’s her recipes, each one linked to a personal story from her incredible
  life.
</blockquote>

So next time I'm in Brisbane...<br>

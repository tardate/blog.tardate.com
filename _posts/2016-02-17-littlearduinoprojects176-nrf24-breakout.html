So recently I've been intrigued by small-batch PCB fab services, like <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a>. Like the ready supply of components from various online sellers, it's amazing how cheap you can get boards made over the net these days. How do they do it? As I learned in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XssjD97-xGM">this hardware hangout</a>, there are some neat tricks done behind the scenes to aggregate small orders into full panels sent to a fab. <br /><br />But to get PCBs made, you need to be able to drive an EDA tool like <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>. KiCad's a beautiful open source tool, but it is quite idiosyncratic. In some spare time, I dived into the <a href="http://txplore.tv/courses/kicad-pro">KiCad like a Pro</a> course and found it an excellent leg-up on the process.<br /><br />The nRF24 breakout board (below) is just the first trivial exercise from the course. But it will come in handy - I have a batch of nRF24's lying around that I've been planning to experiment with, and the breakout board will be quite handy for that.<br /><br />I just received my boards from OSH Park (1 month from order to delivery in Singapore - not bad, especially for $4.80 all-in). Very impressed with the board quality. Not so much with the board design! A few things I can see could be easily improved, but that's my fault (see <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/nRF24Breakout">my notes</a>). But they do work!<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/nRF24Breakout">all notes, schematics and code (including the KiCad project) are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/nRF24Breakout" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/nRF24Breakout/assets/nRF24Breakout_build.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

        <strong>Writers [on Writing]</strong> is a collection of essays from the New York Times. There are 46 or so
        pieces by popular authors, that cover a diverse range of topics of interest to anyone who is going about the
        business of writing - perhaps skewed towards the novelist, but generally relevant to any kind of writer.<br>
        <br>
        From stoking the fires of inspiration and maintaining motiviation, to methods for character and plot
        development, there are stories here for all aspects of the art.<br>
        <br>
        I was particularly taken by Mary Gordon's <em>Putting Pen to Paper, but Not Just Any Pen or Just Any Paper</em>
        in which she describes her prediliction (maybe obsession is a better word) for having the correct writing
        instrument and notebook on hand. More than just comfort or convenience, this is about how certain tools can
        influence your state of mind and thus be conducive to certain work. Mary Gordon elevates this to a science:
        when contemplating a novel in three voices, each character had its own suitably matched notebook. I can
        certainly relate to this! I remember finding that I could only write and study chinese literature effectively
        with a certain kind of notebook with a light 5mm grid, and I had a similar fixation on yellow legal pads for
        essays in high school.<br>
        <br>
        Obviously, Mary does not write using a computer, but it makes you wonder if there is an analogue for those that
        do? And I'm sure just changing your mouse pointer style doesn't do the trick. Stock up on a range of keyboards
        and mice? Or even different machines?<br>
        <br>
        Picking up the theme of notebooks for geeks, Cot√© has an excellent discussion on <a href=

        Moleskin</a> on the <a href="http://dfof.wordpress.com/">Sartorially Orientated Architects</a> site. It's true
        .. this is <em>very important topic!</em>

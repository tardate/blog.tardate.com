Justin reported the <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2007/08/03#a562">stunning success of the OTN lounge</a> at OpenWorld Shanghai 2007. Although I never made it to the lounge, the buzz in the halls and corridors was great testament to the enthusiasm of the Oracle community in this part of the world.<br /><br />My trip up to Shanghai also provided a pointed reminder of China's <a href="http://www.danwei.org/media_regulation/blogspot_blocked_again_ongoing.php">on-again-off-again dance with blogspot</a> (currently "off-again") when I tried to update my blog.<br /><br />Now I'm not going to argue that China needs to cease its attempts to censor the net since I respect it's authority to exercise such control, just as we do in the west but with different values. However I must admit I had never thought of the <strong>collateral damage </strong>inflicted on the Oracle community of users in China, since it seems quite a large number of bloggers on Oracle topics are using one of the blocked platforms.<br /><br />Fortunately it seems that the various Oracle-topic aggregators have not been hit by any of the blocks (and presumably won't be because of the generally non-political content).<br /><br />So I'd encourage the aggregators to note the importance of aggregating full-text feeds with attachments ... <strong>it may be the only chance that some people may have of reading the content</strong> (also works better for anyone with an offline reader anyway).<br /><br />For Oracle, I'd suggest this is another reason why it would be great to <strong>open up to hosting non-employee blogs</strong>.

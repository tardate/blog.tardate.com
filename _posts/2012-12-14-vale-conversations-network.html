So I just listened to the last IT Conversations podcast of all time <a href=
"http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5331.html">All's Well That Ends Well</a>.<br>
<br>
I'll miss the curation they provided. Did you know that 8 out of 10 interesting facts I quote at dinner parties I
learned on the network? ;-)<br>
<br>
And still learning: IT Conversations was the 2nd podcast ever? Apparently Doug Kaye uploaded a feed the day after
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a> posted his first example of using the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_enclosure">RSS enclosure</a> tag.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure the Conversations Network couldn't have remained relevant and valuable for years to come, but it is an
admirable decision to go out on a high and close down gracefully - importantly taking the time and care to ensure that
the content archives remain available indefinitely.<br>

The Bazz Fuss is about the simplest distortion circuit I've ever seen that in fact yields pleasing results.
After a few experiments comparing configurations on a scope I ended up using two S9013 in Darlington configuration.
The result is decidedly luscious, so the final build went in a suitably sweet chocolate noisette box.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

I recently revisited some old projects after watching Ben Eater's
[great video explaining SR latch behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM0DdEaY5sY).
First, I breadboarded a Set-Reset Latch with BJTs in
[LEAP#061](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/DigitalLogic/SRLatch),
tested it with an Arduino in
[LEAP#062](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/DigitalLogic/SRLatchFlipper),
then later built a Set-Reset Latch with NAND gates in
[LEAP#077](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/DigitalLogic/SRLatchWithNorGates).
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

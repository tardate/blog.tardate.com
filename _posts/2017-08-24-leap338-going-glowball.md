The [Glass Eye Studio "Celestial Super Nova"](http://www.glasseyestudio.com/492f-glass-eye-studio-celestial-super-nova/) is quite
an awesome piece of glass work ... I have no idea how these can be manufactured in any quantity with consistency!
Perhaps I should find a [class](http://www.artglasscentre.com/studio.php)?
[Glass work seems all the rage these days](http://embedded.fm/episodes/210)!

You can buy a base with lighting effects, but where is the fun in that?
Here's a project to make a base for the glass ball. Because it is going to sit on a desk, I decided to combine two functions:

* a multi-colour "glow" effect to light the ball
* or switch to power a 3528 LED strip (1m, 60 LEDs, 12V, cold white)

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Here's is a video with a few soothing minutes of the glow effect;-) ...

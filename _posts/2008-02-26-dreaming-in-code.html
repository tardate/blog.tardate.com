<a href="http://www.wordyard.com/">Scott Rosenberg's</a>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4lrKvOG" class="book-title">Dreaming in Code</a>
is the first book in a while that I
have immediately wanted to go out and buy a few extra copies to give to friends. <span style=
"font-style:italic;">They would just so get it as a reflection on their current jobs!</span><br>
<br>
The title <span style="font-weight:bold;">Dreaming In Code</span> is a bit misleading. At first I thought it
was about coding practices - extreme flow state leading to fantasy debugging sessions in your sleep (been
there!). But its not.<br>
<br>
It's fascinating story following Mitch [Lotus 1-2-3] Kapor's quest to build a revolutionary PIM - <a href=
"http://chandlerproject.org/">Chandler</a> - and the organisation he created to do it - <a href=
"http://www.osafoundation.org/">OSAF</a>.<br>
<br>
At times, clearly a mild-to-massively disfunctional undertaking, but Rosenberg's reflective and honest
reporting presents the situation in all its shades. Life is complex. It's not always so easy to 'pin the blame'
for a project failure. Sometimes its not even so easy to tell if the project has failed, which is true for
Chandler since it is still running!<br>
<br>
What makes Rosenberg's book so engaging is that there are multiple layers to the story that speak to different
interests.<br>
<br>
On the one hand this is a ripping yarn about a high-risk startup. On another level the book reflects on
contemporary management and software development practices. But its also the personal story of the very
successful Mitch Kapor potentially facing the biggest failure of his career.<br>
<br>
Overall, this makes for a compelling read for anyone in the business of software development.<br>

Back last year I got all excited about Yahoo Pipes ( <a href="/2007/09/pipes-web-20-wake-up-call-for-bpel.html">Web 2.0
Wake-up Call for BPEL?</a> ) and its graphical approach to building mashups. In fact I still use a Pipes mashup as my
mega-aggregated Oracle newsfeed.<br>
<br>
Now I've discovered a new toy - <a href="http://www.popfly.com">Microsoft Popfly</a> - and finally a reason to install
Silverlight! I remember popfly getting mentioned in Bex Huff's <a href="http://bexhuff.com/node/269">roundup of mashup
tools</a> last year, but at the time it was still in restricted beta.<br>
<br>
Popfly's still in beta, but now open to one and all. Put aside your biases for a minute and go play ... if you are like
me, it will blow your mind. It may not be the final word in mashup tools, but it sure opens your mind to what should be
possible.<br>
<br>
Here's a little mashup I created 5 minutes up the learning curve. It's a cute display of the latest photos posted to
the <a href="http://www.oraclecommunity.net/">Oracle Community</a> site:<br>
Edit: popfly is no more; link to http://www.popfly.com/users/tardate/Oracle%20Community%20Photos.small is defunct.<br>

<em>Postscript: yes, you do need Silverlight installed for this to work of course. Silverlight is available for "all
major browsers running on the Mac OS or Windows". If you are not prompted automatically for the Silverlight install,
visit the <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> site.</em>

I've released an update to Chang Liu's tree-sync.pl script on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/CPAN/Administrative/index.html">CPAN</a> (currently <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/authors/id/P/PA/PAULPG/tree-sync/">tree-sync-2.2.pl</a>).<br /><br />I had some problems with the original script, so this is a re-write that uses an algorithm based on File::Find module. <br /><br />I've only been testing on Windows and Linux, but so far so good - it solves my immiedate issue which was to have a way of maintaining a synchronised "backup" copy of various filesystems.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">PS: As of Oct-2008, the tree-sync project is now on <a href="http://github.com/tardate/tree-sync">github</a>. Use this if you want to contribute to development. Of course, releases will still be distributed for use on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/CPAN/Administrative/index.html">CPAN</a>. </span>

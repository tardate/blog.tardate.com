Voltmeter modules are a very convenient way of adding voltage display to any project, because they require no supporting circuitry or microcontrollers.<br /><br />There are two and three wire modules in the market. Two-wire modules are the simplest (and generally cheapest). For most applications where a simple readout of a power supply is required, they are most convenient since a separate power supply connection is not required. It does mean of course that the meter draws current from the circuit under test, and will only work down to a certain voltage (usually ~4.5V).<br /><br />For more precision measurement, the three-wire modules are best as they present relatively high input impedance (> 100kÎ©), and can measure voltages all the way down to 0. As an example, Adafruit have <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/705">this 3-wire module</a> in their catalogue, but they are widely available from most online sellers.<br /><br />I recently received a 3-wire module as part of a kit and put it to the test. Using my DMM as a reference, it appears accuracy is within 40mV, good enough for general purposes.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/VoltmeterModule">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/VoltmeterModule" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6eY3KapQv8s/Vrs0cgKW9NI/AAAAAAAAZ64/V-sh6mrWMew/s320/VoltmeterModule_clip.png" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

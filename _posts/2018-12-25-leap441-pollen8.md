"Pollen8" is an exploration of contrasts and patterns in a freeform wire circuit.

I was interest in playing with a design that avoided the harsh angularity of most electronic circuits,
instead using graceful lines that attempt to mimic a more organic structure.

The second goal was to achieve a chameleon-like LED display, where the visual effect depends on the
perspective of the viewer: random from some angles, but clearly sequenced from others.

I created this for the [Hackaday Circuit Sculpture Contest](https://hackaday.io/contest/162559-circuit-sculpture-contest).

As always, [all notes, pictures and schematics are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

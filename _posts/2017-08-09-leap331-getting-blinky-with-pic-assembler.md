Not necessarily everyone's first choice for embedded development these days,
PIC is perhaps now more a right-of-passage!
It was [Julian Ilett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2rZwR9oM_k) who finally inspired me to try this myself.
One thing that held me back was the perception that you have to "downgrade" to Windows in order to get anything going.
Challenge accepted, and I quickly learned that the MPLAB X IDE is just perfect and makes PIC development on MacOSX a piece of cake.
So let's get blinky..
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

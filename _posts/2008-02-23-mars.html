After <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href=
"/2008/01/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></span>, I went back to start with the first
book in <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ben Bova's</span> series -
<a href="https://amzn.to/45FIjOW" class="book-title">Mars</a>.
<br>
<br>
It is a gripping page-turner of the first manned mission to Mars, and the hopes of making the most startling of
discoveries - life on another planet. The book's tension comes from a great balance of the personal story of
the astronauts, the hard-science of the mission, and the all-too-realistic dimension of earthly politics. Real
drama cloaked in a sci-fi setting.<br>
<br>
Looks like I'll be reading the whole series now!

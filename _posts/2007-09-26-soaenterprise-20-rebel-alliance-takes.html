What is the driving force for *2.0 in the enterprise? Deathstar-2.0 jokes aside, <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/fusionecm/2007/09/25#a139">Billy</a> (Fusion ECM) and <a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2007/09/24/moar-power/">Jake</a> (AppsLab) have been nutting this out. Billy's in the "its all about the data" camp, and Jake's taking the "power to the people" stance. Bex has <a href="http://bexhuff.com/2007/09/enterprise-2-0-versus-web-2-0">chipped in</a> with a view that "its about knowledge".<br /><br />You may think its a cop-out, but I think its a case of <em>you're all right</em>. Depends on what perspective you want to take.<br /><br />Yes, its <a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2007/09/20/power-to-the-people-20/">all about me</a>, but in the same way that driving around town is all about me. Until a semi wants to cut into my lane. On the road we have established ways of collaborating to keep things moving nicely (signals, lane markers, the odd toot of a horn). It's all about me in the sense that I want to safely get to where I'm going. But the roads department has a broader objective.<br /><br />I'd suggest that the real difference with Web-2.0 in the wild is that there really is no broader objective to speak of. I blog. I like. That's good enough for me.<br /><br />But in an enterprise, there's always an over-riding agenda that's bigger than any individual: profitability, customer satisfaction, market share etc. If that's not front of mind, you deserve a pink slip .. give you lots of time for facebook!<br /><br />With that in mind, I'd like to share a visualisation of the enterprise I call the "SOA Sphere". Not perfect, by tries to cram a number of key concepts together:<ul><br /><li>Information (data/knowledge) is the core asset of an organisation</li><br /><li>Business Services/processes/applications collaborate with users and act upon the knowledge base</li><br /><li>Security is an all-encompassing capability; a key enabler of innovation</li><br /><li>People live, breath and work together in the environment that these services create. No distinction really between employees, customers, partners or the great unwashed</li><br /></ul><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RvnN7seuO-I/AAAAAAAAALc/mY33XGHcMDI/s1600-h/soasphere1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RvnN7seuO-I/AAAAAAAAALc/mY33XGHcMDI/s400/soasphere1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5114345277291903970" /></a>

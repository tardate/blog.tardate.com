Because you can never have too many function generators??!
I have one built into my oscilloscope, made my own, and will probably build many more! But it is nice to have a full-featured bit of kit as a benchmark.
The Feeltech FY3200S gets some good reviews and was available at a very nice price.
In general it works great, but there are some issues and limitations to note.
As always, [more notes are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><strong>Tricky Business</strong> by <a href="http://www.davebarry.com/">Dave Barry</a>. The first book for a long time that had me snorting with laughter amongst groups of startled strangers.<br /> <br />As Dave Barry says..<br /><blockquote class="quote">This book is dedicated to the people of South Florida, for being so consistently weird</blockquote><br />If I was to classify this book, I'd say its sort of like a Saturday Night Live version of CSI:Miami, directed by the Cohen Bros, and staring all the extras from Miami Vice (the original series). With a twist of Tarantino. Get it?<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0425192741&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

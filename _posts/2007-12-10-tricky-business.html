<a href="https://amzn.to/3HVwqu8" class="book-title">Tricky Business</a>
by <a href="http://www.davebarry.com/">Dave Barry</a>. The first book for a
long time that had me snorting with laughter amongst groups of startled strangers.<br>
<br>
As Dave Barry says..<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  This book is dedicated to the people of South Florida, for being so consistently weird

If I was to classify this book, I'd say its sort of like a Saturday Night Live version of CSI:Miami, directed
by the Cohen Bros, and staring all the extras from Miami Vice (the original series). With a twist of Tarantino.
Get it?<br>

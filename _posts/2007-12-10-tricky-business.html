        <strong>Tricky Business</strong> by <a href="http://www.davebarry.com/">Dave Barry</a>. The first book for a
        long time that had me snorting with laughter amongst groups of startled strangers.<br>
        <br>
        As Dave Barry says..<br>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          This book is dedicated to the people of South Florida, for being so consistently weird
        </blockquote><br>
        If I was to classify this book, I'd say its sort of like a Saturday Night Live version of CSI:Miami, directed
        by the Cohen Bros, and staring all the extras from Miami Vice (the original series). With a twist of Tarantino.
        Get it?<br>

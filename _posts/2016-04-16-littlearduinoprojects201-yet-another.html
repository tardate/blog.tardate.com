aka door-fart according to my better half ... 555 Timer-based oscillators are not exactly the most musical creatures.<br /><br />#201 is a kit build. Ridiculously cheap on <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Perfect-Doorbell-Suite-Electronic-DIY-Kit-for-Home-Security-6V-PCB-3-9-x-3-5/32497451130.html">aliexpress</a>, it even came with extra components, so a bit of a bargain impulse-buy.<br /><br />The kit turned out to be a simplified version of a circuit I've built before. It lacks the power control circuit, and draws about 4mA when idle - so if you actually use it, expect to be replacing batteries on a regular basis.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/555Timer/DoorbellKit">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br />Here's the start of the "ding.." on a 'scope..<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/555Timer/DoorbellKit" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/555Timer/DoorbellKit/assets/scope_trigger.gif?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

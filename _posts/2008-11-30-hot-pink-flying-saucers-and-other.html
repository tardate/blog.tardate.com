        "http://www.kinokuniya.com.sg">Kinokuniya</a> last week. This is a mischievous little "gift book" with some 30
        utterly amazing pictures of "<a href="https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/gallery/filter/cloudalikes">clouds
        that look like things</a>". I had to get it, despite the fact that the 3" x 5" format just doesn't do the
        subject justice. If anything deserved to be a full size coffee table book, this is it!<br>

        The book is produced by the <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/">Cloud Appreciation Society</a>, and
        a magical gallery of images is available on their website. It truly reinvigorates your faith in mankind's inner
        child that organisations such as this exist.

  At The Cloud Appreciation Society we love clouds, we’re not ashamed to say it and we’ve had enough of people moaning

The book has made me look afresh at the skies of Singapore. Living here you don't tend to spend a lot of time looking
up. The tropical humidity and general lack of turbulence make saturated blanket cloud cover pretty much the norm. We
don't have a big weather section in news broadcasts, and no-one really talks about the weather. At night you are lucky
to see the glimmer of a dozen stars (half of which turn out to be 747s coming in to land at Changi).<br>
<br>
But, no, since picking up "Hot Pink.." I've been drawn to looking up, and I think my prejudices might be misguided. Not
everyday, but I realise now there is a little more interesting action going on than I had assumed. I have my camera on
standby now, ready to catch any flying saucers, dogs, ducks, or skateboarders that may make an appearance in our
skies.<br>

can <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/membership/">join the society</a> for just £4.00 + postage. I was
really impressed by the <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/cloud-of-costs/">playful and transparent
disclosure</a> of how membership fees are applied. Certainly the best I've seen for any club or association, short of
ploughing through a really dry P&amp;L statement. Makes me want to sign up, simply as a nod to the good job they have
done! <span style="font-style:italic;">NB: as of 22-Jun-2009, the image link on the cloud costs page appears to be
broken.</span><br>

Anonymous_X has been posting cloud pictures on <a href="http://thecloudsrepresentmyheart.blogspot.com/">The Clouds

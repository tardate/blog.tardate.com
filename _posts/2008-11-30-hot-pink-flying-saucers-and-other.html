<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399534113?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399534113">Hot Pink Flying Saucers and Other Clouds</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0399534113" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> in <a href="http://www.kinokuniya.com.sg">Kinokuniya</a> last week. This is a mischievous little "gift book" with some 30 utterly amazing pictures of "<a href="https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/gallery/filter/cloudalikes">clouds that look like things</a>". I had to get it, despite the fact that the 3" x 5" format just doesn't do the subject justice. If anything deserved to be a full size coffee table book, this is it!<br /><br />

<br />The book is produced by the <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/">Cloud Appreciation Society</a>, and a magical gallery of images is available on their website. It truly reinvigorates your faith in mankind's inner child that organisations such as this exist.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0399534113&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0399533451&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class="quote">At The Cloud Appreciation Society we love clouds, we’re not ashamed to say it and we’ve had enough of people moaning about them.</blockquote><br />The book has made me look afresh at the skies of Singapore. Living here you don't tend to spend a lot of time looking up. The tropical humidity and general lack of turbulence make saturated blanket cloud cover pretty much the norm. We don't have a big weather section in news broadcasts, and no-one really talks about the weather. At night you are lucky to see the glimmer of a dozen stars (half of which turn out to be 747s coming in to land at Changi). <br /><br />But, no, since picking up "Hot Pink.." I've been drawn to looking up, and I think my prejudices might be misguided. Not everyday, but I realise now there is a little more interesting action going on than I had assumed. I have my camera on standby now, ready to catch any flying saucers, dogs, ducks, or skateboarders that may make an appearance in our skies.<br /><br /><br />

As an aside, you can <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/membership/">join the society</a> for just £4.00 + postage. I was really impressed by the <a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/cloud-of-costs/">playful and transparent disclosure</a> of how membership fees are applied. Certainly the best I've seen for any club or association, short of ploughing through a really dry P&L statement. Makes me want to sign up, simply as a nod to the good job they have done! <span style="font-style:italic;">NB: as of 22-Jun-2009, the image link on the cloud costs page appears to be broken.</span> <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">PS: shortly after posting this, I discovered another cloud lover here in Singapore. Anonymous_X has been posting cloud pictures on <a href="http://thecloudsrepresentmyheart.blogspot.com/">The Clouds Represent My Heart</a> site since August!</span>

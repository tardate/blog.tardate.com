</div>I was fired up to try out <a href="https://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a> after seeing <a href=
"https://github.com/cameronpriest">Cameron's</a> presentation at the last <a href=
"https://groups.google.com/group/singapore-rb">Singapore Ruby Brigade</a> meetup.<br>
<br>
Ember is one of the many javascript MVC frameworks that have been sprouting up over the past year, and it seems to
offer a nice level of abstraction. I was quite interested to see how it might fit for a Rails/MongoDB application we're
currently working on, so a few tests were in order.<br>
<br>
I hosted some tests on a Rails 3.2.2 base, and threw in a whole bunch of technologies to see how well they play
together. The story so far:<br>
<ul>
  <li>ruby 1.9.3 + rails 3.2.2 with <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails">rspec-rails</a> and <a href=
  "https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails">factory_girl_rails</a> for testing
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a> - templating for a pure rails alternative to compare with the ember app
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">mongoid</a> - using MongoDB for server-side persistence, to see how
    this plays with ember
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources">inherited_resources</a> - for super thin controllers.
    Works beautifully with ember and Mongo (I literally wrote just a single line in the server-side controller
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a> - the ember distribution...
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails</a> - makes it easy to add ember to the project (gem
    installed with bundler)
  </li>
  <li>CoffeeScript - for the ember scripting
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/cerebris/ember-rest">ember-rest</a> - a simple RESTful resource adapter between ember
    and rails
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> - a gem packaging of
    <a href="https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">twitter bootstrap</a> (adds LESS to the asset pipeline)
  </li>
</ul><br>
Surprisingly, this all hangs together without too much fuss! You can see &amp; fork the demo at <a href=
"https://github.com/evendis/rails-ember-mongo-bootstrap-demo">rails-ember-mongo-bootstrap-demo</a>.<br>
<br>
What's next?<br>
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>Testing:</em> I've got RSpec in the project for conventional testing, but I haven't investigated the best ways
    to test the ember app itself yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Relations:</em> perhaps switching to ember-data to test some non-trivial model associations
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>ember-bootstrap:</em> adds bootstrap components to ember. Sounds promising but my initial attempts to use it
    weren't too successful
  </li>
</ol><br>

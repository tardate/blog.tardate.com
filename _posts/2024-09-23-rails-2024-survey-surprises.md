The results of the [2024 Ruby on Rails Community Survey](https://railsdeveloper.com/survey/2024/) are out.
Are there any surprises? For mw: nothing earth -shattering. But that in itself may be the surprise,
as the results show a re-invigorated community that is perhaps stronger than it has been in years.

While the demographics imply that the
[community is still maturing](https://railsdeveloper.com/survey/2024/#how-many-years-have-you-been-developing-with-rails),
it is still growing enough to replace those "aging out" around the 13 year mark.

Interestingly, the exodus of Ruby/Rails devs around 13 years ago (2011-2012) was just at the time when
node.js, go and rust were starting to break though. Coincidence? I think not!

See the full results at <https://railsdeveloper.com/survey/2024/>.
To be honest, nothing particularly unexpected, just solid confirmation that Rails appears to be
back on a on a very healthy track.

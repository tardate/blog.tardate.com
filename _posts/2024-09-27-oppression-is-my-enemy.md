I can't pinpoint exactly where it comes from, but somewhere along the way I've internalised a core value of "siding with the underdog". Anti-Thatcherite Britain? Aussie tall-poppy syndrome? Catholic public school? Perhaps a mix of all these and more. I was recently introduced to the following quote from [Periyar Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyar) that is I think a perfect formulation of the idea:

> If a larger country oppresses a smaller country, I'll stand with the smaller country.
>
> If the smaller country has majoritarian religion that oppresses minority religions, I'll stand with minority religions.
>
> If the minority religion has caste and one caste oppresses another caste, I'll stand with the caste being oppressed.
>
> In the oppressed caste, if an employer oppresses his employee, I'll stand with the employee.
>
> If employee goes home and oppresses his wife, I'll stand with that woman.
>
> Overall, oppression is my enemy.
>
> *- Thanthai Periyar E. V. Ramasamy (17 Sep, 1879 â€“ 24 Dec, 1973)*

Looking back now, I can see how this quote made the rounds on social media over the past few years, but I haven't yet found a primary source to cite. This may be me running into a language barrier, as I presume his original words were probably in Tamil.

Nevertheless, it explains why my first instincts in all modern conflicts have been right .. IMHO!

And why I think that UN Security Council reform is essential to preserve and improve the prospect for all peoples to enjoy peace and security.

Until now, I thought that was a pipe dream, as who could imaging the US giving up its veto power? But now I see a rising chorus of people calling for reform

[Kishore Mahbubani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishore_Mahbubani)
has argued in the Financial Times that
["UN credibility depends on adjusting veto rights to match shift in global power"](https://www.ft.com/content/abf9a9bb-c88c-4faa-9a86-6ec500bcd5db) .. including quite provocatively suggesting the poetic justice if the UK were to cede its UNSC seat in favour of India.

And everyone seems to be calling for reform at the UN Security Council Open Debate on Leadership for Peace...

- Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has called to ["constrain the exercise of the veto"](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2024/09/UN-Security-Council-Open-Debate)
- French President Emmanuel Macron has ["suggested that the UN Security Council limit veto power"](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240925-ukraine-lebanon-gaza-and-limiting-un-veto-power-takeaways-from-macron-s-speech-at-the-un)
- even the US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield echoed the [need for reform](https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-signature-event-on-leadership-for-peace/) .. but of course without mentioning veto powers; no surprise there.
- But most significantly, I think
[Finland's President Alexander Stubb](https://www.reuters.com/world/finlands-president-wants-end-single-state-veto-un-security-council-2024-09-18/) may have punched a winning ticket by calling for expansion of the U.N. Security Council, abolition of its single state veto power, and suspension of any member engaging in an "illegal war".

Please, **no to the veto!**

As I found in <a href="https://amzn.to/4njImGo">Leon: Ingredients and Recipes</a><br>

Well I must be nuts. Whether it is sweet delicious nuggets in the best <a href=
"http://mimi-fingers-tips.blogspot.com/2008/04/bak-kuh-teh.html">Bak Kuh Teh</a>, or sliced in your favourite
<a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/recipes/vegetable_stir_fry.php">Thai stir fry</a>, garlic claims its
place as one of the four essential pillars of great cuisine (along with salt, pepper and chili).<br>
<br>
One of my most memorable dining experiences was at the Stinking Rose in San Francisco (they have a great
cookery book available).

But as usual, simple is
best. I don't think there is anything better than fresh bread toasted with virgin olive oil, and rubbed with fresh
garlic before immediate consumption. Warm, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside with the sharp pungency of fresh,
raw garlic.<br>
<br>
Mmmmmmmm....

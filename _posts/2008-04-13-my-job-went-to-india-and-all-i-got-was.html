The title may be provocative, and immediately engender some strong reactions, but having just read
<a href="https://amzn.to/4lipzJz" class="book-title">My Job Went to India</a>
by <a href=
"http://chadfowler.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chad Fowler</span></a>, I'd strongly recommend you get
past the emotions and read this book now!<br>
<br>
It is actually a very sensitive and insightful treatment of career pressures of the modern age, and how to
respond positively. Although primarily targetted at a those working in the software industry, the book is a
great career coach for any white-collar <span style="font-style:italic;">information worker</span>.<br>
<br>
The book contains 52 very well-written pieces of advice, all introduced with some fascinating personal
introspection.<br>
<br>
Get it on your bookshelf! The sooner, the better.<br>

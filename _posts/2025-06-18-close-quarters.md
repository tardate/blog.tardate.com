Close Quarters (1943) is a docudrama that follows a Royal Navy submarine on a North Sea patrol during World War II.
It uses vessels, equipment, and crew of the day,
being filmed onboard the Royal Navy T-class Submarine
[N76 HMS Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Tribune_(N76)).

HMS Tribune survived the war and was scrapped in 1947.

## Submarine On Patrol (1943)

Submarine On Patrol is a British World War II information film describing to the public the technicalities and roles of Royal Navy submarine operations.

Again it features HMS Tribune masquerading as *HMS Tyrant*.

While it appears to have been made at the same time as filming of "Close Quarters", most of the footage is unique.

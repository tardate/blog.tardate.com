The "Granular Synth" idea harks back to an old [Auduino](http://code.google.com/p/tinkerit/wiki/Auduino) project.
I stumbled upon it again recently and decided it deserved a quick build in an Altoids tin ..

.. because granular synthesis is a basically how they make Altoids, right?

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

If you can put up with 5 minutes of me fiddling around, here's a taste of how it performs..

OK, I jumped the gun by about 12 hours when I posted my <a href="/2007/10/oraclesap-battlelines-for-future.html">little pitch</a> on why the battle for enterprise developer mindshare will prove more significant than the recent focus on BI acquisitions by Oracle and SAP. <br /><br />Now we have the news that <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6213235.html">Oracle is offering to buy BEA Systems</a>. Long a favourite speculation, its amazing to see it really happen. If this goes through it will basically make IBM and Oracle the two leading Enterprise Java Platform providers. <br /><br />Certainly Oracle couldn't risk BEA ending up in SAP's hands, and Oracle has long been strategically committed to Java. But holding such a strong hand could be a problem if it leads to a kind of Java-only tunnel vision.

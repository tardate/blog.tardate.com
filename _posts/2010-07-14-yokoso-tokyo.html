My Nexus One and the Japanese telcos had a 'lost in translation' syndrome over the past week, but I am back home now in
Singapore with all the broadband that entails! I think I'll be retro-blogging for weeks to make up for the few

most of a short trip..<br>

<span style="font-style:italic;">After stumbling off the Airport Express bus and checking in early, what else to do but
hunt down the lair of the famed Godzilla (ゴジラ, Gojira) near Ginza (銀座). She's HUGE! (No, that is sarcastic. Artistic
camera angles are required)</span><br>

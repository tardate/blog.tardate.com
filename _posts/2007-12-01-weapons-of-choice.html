Talk about a page turner!<br>
<br>
I've shied away from John Birmingham's
<a href="https://amzn.to/3TCSFaS" class="book-title">Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)</a>
for ages. It's always staring at me on the shelf in the bookstore.
Chunky like Neal Stephenson's <a href="https://amzn.to/4ejzUmf" class="book-title">Quicksilver</a>. All about a
21st century US-lead naval group <em>time-travelling</em> back into the battle of Midway in 1942. Gimme a
break. I've got better things to do with my time!<br>
<br>
But curiosity got the better of me down at Kinokuniya last week and I picked up a copy. A plane flight and a
few evenings later it is dog-eared and done, and I am looking for the next volume.<br>
<br>
Birmingham does a decent job of setting the scientific basis to explain the time-travel bit. At least convinced
me to the level of my understanding of string theory and quantum mechanics! Add some ego and a major cluster
f#$k in a lab (easier to understand) and you are back in 1942. By then you are caught up in the story and the
pages fly.<br>
<br>
<strong>It might be easy to write this off as a macho, techno-military thriller in the Tom Clancy vein, but
this book offers much more when you get thinking.</strong><br>
<br>
Without grinding your face in it, there's a great study and commentary on how morals and ethics have been
through a rapid evolutionary process over the past century. Birmingham doesn't hold back when it comes to the
reality of modern racial and gender attitudes facing off against WW2-era society. <em>African-american, female
naval Captain suddenly thrown into 1942?</em> Don't expect the locals to just marvel at your ship and say
thanks for the help.<br>
<br>
What comes a little unexpected to the modern mind is the challenge that it is not all a one way street. Being
comfortable with unleashing the mass death and destruction that 21st century weapons are capable of is not a
natural state of being. <strong>Makes you think about what we've lost for all the gains of modern
society.</strong><br>
<br>
There's a lot of thought that has gone into the alternate future/past that Birmingham has created. A great deal
to ponder.<br>
<br>
And/or you can just dive in for a rollicking good yarn.<br>
<br>
<em>Postscript: I was browsing movies in HMV the other day and stumbled across
<a href="https://amzn.to/44pKOCK" class="book-title">The Final Countdown</a>. I'd completely forgotten
about watching this 1980's movie (telling?) that has USS Nimitz time-warping back to just before Pearl Harbour.
Similar idea that might have inspired <strong>Weapons of Choice</strong>, but Birmingham has taken the concept
to new heights.</em>

        Talk about a page turner!<br>
        <br>
        I've shied away from John Birmingham's <strong><a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345457137?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345457137">
        Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)</a><img src=
        "https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0345457137" width="1" height="1"
        border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></strong> for ages. It's always
        staring at me on theshelf in the bookstore. Chunky like Neal Stephenson's <a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060593083?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060593083">
        Quicksilver</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060593083"
        width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">. All about a
        21st century US-lead naval group <em>time-travelling</em> back into the battle of Midway in 1942. Gimme a
        break. I've got better things to do with my time!<br>
        <br>
        But curiosity got the better of me down at Kinokuniya last week and I picked up a copy. A plane flight and a
        few evenings later it is dog-eared and done, and I am looking for the next volume.<br>
        <br>
        Birmingham does a decent job of setting the scientific basis to explain the time-travel bit. At least convinced
        me to the level of my understanding of string theory and quantum mechanics! Add some ego and a major cluster
        f#$k in a lab (easier to understand) and you are back in 1942. By then you are caught up in the story and the
        pages fly.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>It might be easy to write this off as a macho, techno-military thriller in the Tom Clancy vein, but
        this book offers much more when you get thinking.</strong><br>
        <br>
        Without grinding your face in it, there's a great study and commentary on how morals and ethics have been
        through a rapid evolutionary process over the past century. Birmingham doesn't hold back when it comes to the
        reality of modern racial and gender attitudes facing off against WW2-era society. <em>African-american, female
        naval Captain suddenly thrown into 1942?</em> Don't expect the locals to just marvel at your ship and say
        thanks for the help.<br>
        <br>
        What comes a little unexpected to the modern mind is the challenge that it is not all a one way street. Being
        comfortable with unleashing the mass death and destruction that 21st century weapons are capable of is not a
        natural state of being. <strong>Makes you think about what we've lost for all the gains of modern
        society.</strong><br>
        <br>
        There's a lot of thought that has gone into the alternate future/past that Birmingham has created. A great deal
        to ponder.<br>
        <br>
        And/or you can just dive in for a rollicking good yarn.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Postscript: I was browsing movies in HMV the other day and stumbled across <strong><a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000096IAD?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000096IAD">
        The Final Countdown</a><img src=
        "https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000096IAD" width="1" height="1"
        border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></strong>. I'd completely forgotten
        about watching this 1980's movie (telling?) that has USS Nimitz time-warping back to just before Pearl Harbour.
        Similar idea that might have inspired <strong>Weapons of Choice</strong>, but Birmingham has taken the concept
        to new heights.</em>

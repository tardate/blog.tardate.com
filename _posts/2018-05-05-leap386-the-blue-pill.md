Popularly known as the [Blue Pill](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill),
the STM32F103C8T6 Minimum System Development Board seems like an excellent gateway drug for getting into ARM Cortex-M3 development.

This is particularly true as it is possible to program it with the familar Arduino IDE.

It is my first look at one of these boards, so I have simple expectations - follow along some of the tutorials
on the web/youtube and at least get a simple program running on the board. In the process I'll learn
a bit more about the board's capabilities and quirks.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

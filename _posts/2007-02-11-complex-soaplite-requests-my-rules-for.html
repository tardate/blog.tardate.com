<a href="/2007/01/simple-perl-clients-for-axis2-with.html">Previously</a>, I mentioned I'd come back to more complex
request and response structures with SOAP::Lite.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I haven't posted because I can't avoid the feeling that there's still a little more to unravel. Did I mention
that good documentation is sparse? ;) Byrne and others have posted some good stuff (see for example the <a href=
"http://www.majordojo.com/archives/cat_soaplite_solutions.html">majordojo soaplite archive</a> and this <a href=
"http://builder.com.com/5100-6389-1045078.html">hands-on tour</a> at builder.com), but mostly you'll find the
experiences shared go along lines like "...after hacking around for a bit, I found that this worked...".<br>
<br>
But is it possible to try and pin down at least a couple of guidelines for using SOAP::Data? Well, so far I can't claim
to solving it all, but I am able to share a few anchors I've tried to plant for my own sanity!<br>
<br>
<h2>
  My Rules for SOAP::Sanity
</h2><br>
In the following "rules", $soap is a pre-initialised SOAP::Lite object, as in:<br>
<i>my $soap = SOAP::Lite-&gt;uri ( $serviceNs ) -&gt; proxy ( $serviceUrl );</i><br>
<br>
<h3>
  1. The value of a SOAP::Data element becomes the content of the XML entity.
</h3><br>
It may seem bleeding obvious. Nevertheless, get this idea fixed in you head and it will help for more complex
structures.<br>
<br>
So if we are calling a "getHoroscope" service with the following request structure:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
&lt;getHoroscope&gt;<br>&lt;sign&gt;Aries&lt;/sign&gt;<br>&lt;/getHoroscope&gt;<br>
</pre><br>
"Aries" is the value, i.e. the content, of the XML entity called "sign". Thus our request will look like this:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
$data = SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Aries');<br>$som = $soap-&gt;getHoroscope( $data );
</pre><br>
<h3>
  2. To create a hiearchy of entities, use references to a SOAP::Data structure.
</h3><br>
In (1), the content of the entity was a simple string ("Aries"). Here we consider the case where we need the content to
encapsulate more XML elements rather than just a string. For example a request with this structure:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
&lt;getHoroscope&gt;<br>&lt;astrology&gt;<br>&lt;sign&gt;Aries&lt;/sign&gt;<br>&lt;/astrology&gt;<br>&lt;/getHoroscope&gt;
</pre><br>
Here "astrology" has an XML child element rather than a string value.<br>
To achieve this, we set the value of the "astrology" element as a <i>reference</i> to the "sign" SOAP::Data object:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
$data = SOAP::Data-&gt;name("astrology" =&gt;<br>  \SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Aries') <br>);<br>$som = $soap-&gt;getHoroscope( $data );
</pre><br>
<br>
<h3>
  3. To handle multiple child entities, encapsuate as reference to a SOAP::Data collection.
</h3><br>
In this case, we need our "astrology" element to have multiple children, for example:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
&lt;getHoroscope&gt;<br>&lt;astrology&gt;<br>&lt;sign&gt;Aries&lt;/sign&gt;<br>&lt;sign&gt;Pisces&lt;/sign&gt;<br>&lt;/astrology&gt;<br>&lt;/getHoroscope&gt;
</pre><br>
So a simple variation on (2). To achieve this, we collect the "Aries" and "Pisces" elements as a collection within an
anonymous SOAP::Data object. We pass a reference to this object as the value of the "astrology" item.<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
$data = SOAP::Data-&gt;name("astrology" =&gt; <br>  \SOAP::Data-&gt;value(<br>   SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Aries'), <br>   SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Pisces') <br>   )<br>);<br>$som = $soap-&gt;getHoroscope( $data ); 
</pre><br>
<h3>
  4. Clearly distinguish method name structures from data.
</h3><br>
This is perhaps just a style and clarity consideration. In the examples above, the method has been implicitly
dispatched ("getHoroscope").<br>
If you prefer (or need) to pass the method information to a SOAP::Lite call, I like to keep the method information
distinct from the method data.<br>
<br>
So for example, item (3) can be re-written (including some additional namespace handling) as:<br>
<pre name="code" class="xml:wraplines:nocontrols">
$data = SOAP::Data-&gt;name("astrology" =&gt; <br>  \SOAP::Data-&gt;value(<br>   SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Aries'), <br>   SOAP::Data-&gt;name("sign" =&gt; 'Pisces') <br>   )<br>);<br>$som = $soap-&gt;call( <br>   SOAP::Data-&gt;name('x:getHoroscope')-&gt;attr({'xmlns:x' =&gt; $serviceNs})<br>   =&gt; $data <br>);
</pre><br>
I prefer to read this than have it all mangled together.<br>
<br>
That brings me to the end of my list of rules! I am by no means confident that there aren't more useful guidelines to
be added, or that in fact the ones I have proposed above will even stand the test of time.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, with these four ideas clearly in mind, I find I have a fair chance of sitting down to write a complex
SOAP::Lite call correctly the first time, rather than the trial and error approach I used to be very familiar with!

        I remember seeing <a href="http://www.lifeaftercoffee.com/2007/11/14/oracle-shell-scripting-now-available/">Jon
        Emmons' announcement</a> on the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/orana/">Oracle News Aggregator</a> and
        I've had it in my <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/pratalife/books?category=wanted">"wanted" list on
        bookjetty</a> for ages.<br>
        <br>
        This week I discovered Jon's <a href=

        I wish more DBAs had read this book. In fact it should be mandatory to get an <a href=

</table>Let's face it, most Oracle installations are running on a *nix variant, and you can't be a DBA if you are not
comfortable at both the SQL*Plus and shell prompt. To be a good and efficient DBA in my book, I want to see evidence of
thinking smart, and repetitive task automation. When I see so-called DBAs who are happy to type the same "select ..
from v$.." query every day of their working life, I doubt their brain is switched on, and I find it really, really
scary to think they have the sys/system passwords!<br>
<br>
They say <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060606-crows.html">tool usage</a> is a sure sign of
advanced intelligence in birds. And the same applies to all of us in IT. The three examples I look for at an Oracle
Database installation are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>RMAN
  </li>
  <li>Grid Control
  </li>
  <li>Shell scripts
  </li>
</ul><br>
If none of these are present, then I tend to presume the <span style="font-style:italic;">real</span> DBA has long left
the building. Even if you are using third-party alternatives, do you continue to re-evaluate the Oracle capabilities
with each new release?<br>
<br>
Jon Emmons' book is of course more focused than this. It perfectly fills a niche, with an approachable, practical and
comprehensive coverage of shell scripting from a DBA's perspective.<br>
<br>
I can see the ideal audience for this book is people who are reasonable familiar with Oracle administration but are new
to shell scripting. This book will rapidly teach you all you need to know on the scripting side (and let you skip alot
of stuff you can learn later).<br>
<br>
In other words, if you are a DBA who has just been assigned to manage a Unix-based system for the first time in your
career: <span style="font-weight:bold;">get this book</span>. Forget all the (great) general Linux/Unix/shell scripting
books for now. Don't even think the Oracle docs will teach you what you need to know. <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977671550?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0977671550">

alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"> is what you need!<br>
<br>
If you are coming the other way though - an experienced Linux admin being told that from Monday you also need to manage
an Oracle database - I'd say this book probably doesn't have much to teach you. There's much more you'd need to learn
about Oracle first (after telling your manager he's crazy), and there are really no scripting tricks in the book that
you shouldn't already know. The main benefit you get would probably be a few pages in chapter 6 that cover the tricks
of using sqlplus in a shell script - all in one place rather than having to tease it out of the Oracle docs (see this
related question on <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327777/sqlplus-access-and-email-access-using-shell-script">stackoverflow</a>).

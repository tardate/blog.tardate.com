A Bob Pease tribute, this LM331 voltage-to-frequency kit was the first Boldport Club project.
I joined the Boldport Club rather late, and missed out on the original Pease kit (now out of stock).
But I did manage to snaffle the PCB in sale of "Just Less the Perfect" boards.
Since I was kit-less, I decided to experiment a bit and slow down the frequency - the end result is a light/voltage controlled "blinky".
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Here's a quick demo video to show it works..

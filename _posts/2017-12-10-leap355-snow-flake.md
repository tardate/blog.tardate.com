When @LuckResistor announced the [Snow Flake](https://luckyresistor.me/order-snow-flake-panel/)
to the Boldport Club community, I knew I had to join in!

The Snow Flake is an Atmel SAM D ARM Cortex-M0-controlled LED ornament.
I've just completed building the first Once I have built some more I will be able to experiment with co-ordinated operation, but even a single snowflake makes for an impressive display.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

The LED animation effects look much better in video form of course :

I keep finding new uses for GitHub Pages - situations where in the past I would otherwise have spun up a web site on
heroku or similar. But if the site can be static, and especially if you are already hosting the git repository at
GitHub, Pages are perfect.<br>
<br>
For a long time, I've maintained the LittleArduinoProjects project index as a simple table in the README. But it wasn't
particularly nice or usable, so I decided to pimp it up and serve the catalog index with pages. Turned out to be a
piece of cake (with a few scripts to convert the old index to JSON for the catalog page.<br>
<br>
So here it is, <a href="https://leap.tardate.com">Little Electronics &amp; Arduino Projects at
leap.tardate.com</a>:<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://leap.tardate.com"><img border="0" src=
  "https://leap.tardate.com/catalog/assets/images/leap-splash.png" style="width: 90%"></a>
</div><br>
As always - and since the gh-pages code lives in the same repo - <a href=
"https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/catalog">all notes and code for the catalog are available
in the same Little Electronics &amp; Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br>
<br>

The Tap is a Boldport Club retro reproduction of a lovely 7400-series logic circuit published in a 1974 Elektor article.
It implements four touch-sensitive inputs and multiple outputs: logic-level and it's complement,
as well as open-collector equivalents able to sink greater current.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

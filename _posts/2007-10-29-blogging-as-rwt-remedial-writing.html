A collegue of mine said I must have a case of <strong>blog-addiction</strong> since I'm maintaining two personal blogs - <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com">tardate</a> and <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com">pratalife</a> - as well as a group internal blog. So of course, how could I respond other than by blogging about it? ;-)<br /><br />For me, the motivation to blog actually stems from a recognition that after 20 years of a technical consulting career I find myself with a kind of literary disability! I've been trained too well to think and write like this:<br /><ul><br /><li>Background</li><br /><ul><br /><li>Early years: enjoyed art. English teacher voted me "most likely to write a novel"</li><br /><li>Shift to science/math high school major</li><br /><li>4 years of engineering/computing degree</li><br /><li>20 years in IT - development/project management/consulting</li><br /></ul><br /><li>Understanding of the problem</li><br /><ul><br /><li>Think in bullet points</li><br /><li>Focus on logical presentation of argument/point-of-view</li><br /><li>Descriptive and narrative writing not needed</li><br /><ul><br /><li><em>(may be spoken)</em></li><br /><li>drop adjectives - except for sales-related like "best practice", "open standards-based", "agile"</li><br /></ul><br /></ul><br /><li>Solution</li><br /><ul><br /><li>Start a blog</li><br /><li>Start writing full sentences again</li><br /><li>Focus on story-line, experiment with techniques for getting a message across</li><br /><li>Cover wider range of topics and subject matter</li><br /><li>Form of <strong>Remedial Writing Therapy</strong> (RWT)</li><br /></ul><br /><li>Benefits</li><br /><ul><br /><li>Rediscover vocabulary</li><br /><li>Build story-telling skills</li><br /><li>Rekindle interest in broader range of intellectual pursuits</li><br /><li>Even with a small audience, some chance of feedback</li><br /></ul><br /><li>Not in scope</li><br /><ul><br /><li>Won't help learning how to use a real pen again!</li><br /></ul><br /></ul><br />So is it working? I think so. The first effect I noticed is an almost immediate improvement in my ability to sit down with a topic, get into a flow and quickly produce a finished piece. Remember essay writing at school? Yes, like that. <br /><br />I will leave you to be the judge of whether what I have to say makes any sense or is of any interest!<br /><br /><em>NB: Yes, you may have noticed my homage to Aaron Swartz' <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000931">Powerpoint Remix</a>, which is included in Joel Spolsky's excellent anthology <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/10/best-software-writing-i.html">The Best Software Writing I</a></em>

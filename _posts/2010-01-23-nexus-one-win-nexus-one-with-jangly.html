..or so my better half would say!<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Google/HTC Nexus One</a> is an amazing phone. I love it. Along with <span style=
"font-style:italic;"><a href=
"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/12/23/apple_schedules_special_event_for_jan_26_2010_report.html">whatever
Apple are announcing next week</a></span> I really think it will be a big factor behind augmented reality and always-on
mobile internet going mainstream in 2010.<br>
<br>
But I do agree with Dvorak who made the point that <a href=
"http://www.vidoemo.com/yvideo.php?i=d2ZOYlhucWuRpenhoaDQ&amp;john-c-dvorak-s-review-of-the-google-nexus-one">the Nexus
One is <span style="font-style:italic;">slippery</span> and easy to drop</a>, so the fact that Google/HTC packed in
every feature but the kitchen sink but did <span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span> include a lanyard point is a
major FAIL.<br>
<br>
But not just for practical reasons... for some, the wrist strap is just a great way to bling your phone.<br>
<br>
My partner has a handful of bells, pets and chains hanging out of her blackberry. I'm sure if she got a Nexus it would
end up looking like this..<br>

<br>
But all her excitement for the phone disappeared when she discovered there's no lanyard point to make this possible.
Not interested!!<br>
<br>
Did Apple start this trend of <span style="font-style:italic;">"smartphones don't need a lanyard point"</span>? I'm
sure Steve would hate to see all those jangly bits falling out of one of his devices.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, maybe there's some cunning google geek logic at work..

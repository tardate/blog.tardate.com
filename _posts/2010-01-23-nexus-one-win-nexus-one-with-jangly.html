..or so my better half would say!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Google/HTC Nexus One</a> is an amazing phone. I love it. Along with <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/12/23/apple_schedules_special_event_for_jan_26_2010_report.html">whatever Apple are announcing next week</a></span> I really think it will be a big factor behind augmented reality and always-on mobile internet going mainstream in 2010.<br /><br />But I do agree with Dvorak who made the point that <a href="http://www.vidoemo.com/yvideo.php?i=d2ZOYlhucWuRpenhoaDQ&john-c-dvorak-s-review-of-the-google-nexus-one">the Nexus One is <span style="font-style:italic;">slippery</span> and easy to drop</a>, so the fact that Google/HTC packed in every feature but the kitchen sink but did <span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span> include a lanyard point is a major FAIL.<br /><br />But not just for practical reasons... for some, the wrist strap is just a great way to bling your phone.<br /><br />My partner has a handful of bells, pets and chains hanging out of her blackberry. I'm sure if she got a Nexus it would end up looking like this..<br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/S1rOJaPpR1I/AAAAAAAABCw/BhUrJfUf85I/s1600-h/nexus_with_bling5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/S1rOJaPpR1I/AAAAAAAABCw/BhUrJfUf85I/s400/nexus_with_bling5.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429878961807640402" /></a><br />But all her excitement for the phone disappeared when she discovered there's no lanyard point to make this possible. Not interested!!<br /><br />Did Apple start this trend of <span style="font-style:italic;">"smartphones don't need a lanyard point"</span>? I'm sure Steve would hate to see all those jangly bits falling out of one of his devices.<br /><br />Come to think of it, maybe there's some cunning google geek logic at work..<blockquote class="quote">No lanyard point = less chance of the phone being purloined by the gf/wife!</blockquote><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Soundtrack for this post? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011ZTC7U?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0011ZTC7U">All Within My Hands</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0011ZTC7U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - Metallica</span>

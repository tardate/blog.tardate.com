Maps have always intrigued me. As a career seafarer, my Dad always had nautical charts around the house, and drawing a
map of a saxon village is one of my most distinct primary school memories.<br>
<br>
I just stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.handmaps.org">Hand Drawn Maps Association</a>, which will be publishing a
collection of hand drawn maps and in anticipation is running a contest for everyone to submit their own maps. In terms
of esoteric deliciousness, this is certainly up there with the <a href="https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/">Cloud
Appreciation Society</a><br>
One of my favourite user submissions so far is David Donachie's RPG coastal map of the country of Tanaloth.<br>
<br>

<br>
Maps also played a role in a book a recently finished listening to. Tim Severin's
<a href="https://amzn.to/45GdyJG" class="book-title">Corsair</a>
is the story of
Hector Lynch who is taken from Ireland by slavers from the Barbary Coast and recounts his adventures to escape
captivity. He helps his friend Dan, a slave from the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Coast">Miskito Coast</a>, turn his tattoo skills to map illustration
for their Turkish master and take another step towards freedom.<br>
<br>
Corsair is a ripping yarn in the best swashbuckling tradition, however the details that Severin weaves into the
tale provide a fascinatingly different perspective on the 17th century, one that is more centered on the North
African and Islamic world in both location and outlook.
<br>
<br>
The audible reading is brilliantly delivered by Rupert Farley. Highly recommended.<br>

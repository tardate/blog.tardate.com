As any good electronics hobbyist must have done,
I've already built a decade programmable resistor box - see [LEAP#414](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/DecadeProgrammableResistor) -
but this is one with the Boldport twist. Yes, real pots.

A [decade box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_box) is an old-fashioned bit of test equipment, allowing
an arbitrary resistance to be dialed up to order.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

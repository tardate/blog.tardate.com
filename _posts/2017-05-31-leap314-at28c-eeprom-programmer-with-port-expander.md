The AT28C16 is an old-school 2k x 8-bit parallel EEPROM. Since it has parallel addressing and data lines, it opens a whole range of possibilities with discrete logic circuits (i.e. no SPI or IÂ²C in sight).
I was inspired to explore more by [Ben Eater's use of EEPROMs for his 8-bit computer build](https://youtu.be/K88pgWhEb1M).
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

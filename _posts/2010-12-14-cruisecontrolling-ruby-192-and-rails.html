<a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/">CruiseControl for Ruby</a> from <a href=
"http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughWorks</a> has long been one of the easiest ways to your rails project under
continuous integration.<br>
<br>
But there's still an issue that it <a href=
"http://groups.google.com/group/cruisecontrolrb-rubyforge-mailing-list/browse_thread/thread/81892db289a9a360?pli=1">can't
run under Ruby 1.9.x</a>. That's not very good if you are targeting 1.9.2 for your project.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick recipe for how you <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> build a 1.9.2 project with CC, using the
wonders of <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a>..<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
# download and unpack CC to /usr/local/cruisecontrol-1.4.0 (or where you like)<br># for convenience, add .rvmrc in /usr/local/cruisecontrol-1.4.0 to have it run 1.8.7<br>echo "rvm 1.8.7-p302" &gt; /usr/local/cruisecontrol-1.4.0/.rvmrc<br># configure CC:<br>cd /usr/local/cruisecontrol-1.4.0<br>./cruise add my_project_name --source-control git --repository git@github.com:myname/myproject.git<br># ^^ This will initialize the ~/.cruise/projects/my_project_name folder for a git-based project<br><br># if you have an .rvmrc file in your git repo, pre-emptively trust it to avoid clogging CC:<br>mkdir ~/.cruise/projects/my_project_name<br>rvm rvmrc trust ~/.cruise/projects/my_project_name<br>
</pre><br>
In ~/.cruise/projects/my_project_name, edit cruise_config.rb to run a shell script instead of the standard build task
(I'm calling it ccbuild.sh and it will be in the root of my git repo):<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
Project.configure do |project|<br>  # [.. other stuff ..]<br>  project.build_command = './ccbuild.sh'<br>  # [.. other stuff ..]<br>end
</pre><br>
Add ccbuild.sh to your repository (don't forget to chmod u+x it). It needs to ensure rvm script is loaded and activate
the correct ruby &amp; gemset.<br>
<br>
The script initialization is necessary because it seems the way CC spawns the shell script it doesn't pick up the rvm
initialization you might already have in .bash_profile. Without rvm script initialization, "rvm" will invoke the binary
which can't make the direct environment mods it needs to do.<br>
<br>
Here's what I have in ccbuild.sh:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
#!/bin/bash<br><br>if [ "$(type rvm | head -1)" != "rvm is a function" ]<br>then<br>  source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm || exit 1<br>fi<br><br>if [ "$(type rvm | head -1)" != "rvm is a function" ]<br>then<br>  echo "rvm not properly installed and available"<br>  exit 1<br>fi<br><br>rvm use 1.9.2-p0@mygemsetname --create<br>bundle check || bundle install || exit 1<br>rake # setup to run all required tests by default
</pre><br>
Once that's checked in and pushed to the repo, you can kick-off CC:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
<br>cd /usr/local/cruisecontrol-1.4.0<br>./cruise start<br>
</pre><br>
Now my <a href="http://ccmenu.sourceforge.net/">ccmenu</a> is green, and CruiseControl is running my project under
1.9.2 and rails 3.0.2;-)<br>

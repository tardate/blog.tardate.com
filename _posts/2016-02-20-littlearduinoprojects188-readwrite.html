The AT24C02 is from <a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/memories/serial/default.aspx">Atmel's line of serial EEPROM
chips</a> with a whopping capacity of 2K! (256 x 8) That's not a whole lot more than the onboard EEPROM in an Arduino,
but it does have the advantage of being external:<br>
<ul>
  <li>it can stay in-situ even if the microcontroller disappears/gets exchanged
  </li>
  <li>multiple devices can share access
  </li>
</ul>There are a few libraries available that encapsulate the interaction with external EEPROMs, but first step is a
simple test of the basic read and write capability using the basic Wire library. Surprise, it just works (as long as
you get your bits and bytes ordered correctly).<br>

As always, <a href=

schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br>

Can I build a program for the OSHChip using the gcc toolchain and Nordic Semi SDK on MacOSX? <br /><br />Yes..ish!<br /><br />Here are my notes and scripts for compiling and deploy a simple program, but there remain a few rough edges. There are probably easier ways to do this ... like using the Official Yotta target for OSHChip using gcc ... but I was curious to see how far I could get with just gcc and the Nordic Semi SDK.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/OSHChip/GccToolchain">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>. <br /><p></p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://leap.tardate.com" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://leap.tardate.com/OSHChip/GccToolchain/assets/GccToolchain_build.jpg" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">AXIS 1.3</a> was released back in October, so I thought it was about time to test
it out with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/oc4j/">Oracle Application Server Containers for J2EE
10g (10.1.2.0)</a>. Good news .. all went absolutely smoothly, no frigging about with jar files at all.<br>
Since Axis is a simple web module, manually deploying to Standalone OC4J is straightforward. After putting the web
application files in place, register the module in application.xml and the web app root in http-web-site.xml:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>copy the axis webapp directory into $ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/home/applications/axis
  </li>
  <li>edit $ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/config/application.xml to add &lt;&lt;code&gt;web-module id="axis"
  path="../applications/axis"/&gt;
  </li>
  <li>edit $ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/config/http-web-site.xml<br>
    to add &lt;&lt;code&gt;web-app application="default" name="axis" root="/axis"/&gt;
  </li>
</ol>At this point, I had the AXIS welcome page coming up nicely at http://localhost/axis/. For the <i>next</i> 5
minutes, I played around with some drop-in web services. Very cool and easy!

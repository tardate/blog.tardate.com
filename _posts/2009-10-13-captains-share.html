<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/captains-share/"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 144px; height: 212px;" src="http://www.podiobooks.com/images/covers/CaptainsShare.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2008/03/half-share-full-share-and-beyond.html">Last year, I wrote about Ishmael Wang's blossoming career</a> on the ships within Nathan Lowell's wonderfully realised future universe of inter-galactic trading.<br /><br />We last heard of Ishmael when he'd made it to full share and there's been an excrutiatingly long silence as we wait to hear more of his story. But Nathan was on a promise - it was coming! <br /><br />I must admit I was wondering whether the latest installment would keep up the high standards that Mr Lowell has set for realistic, humanist, hard sci-fi. But now that I've started reading ("listening") to <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/captains-share/">Captain's Share</a>, I know my worries are for naught. <br /><br />If you think it is remotely possible, I'd say that Nathan Lowell has met and exceeded the standards of story-telling that he set with the earlier books in the saga.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the <a href="http://solarclipper.com/about/">Age of the Solar Clipper</a>, I heartily recommend you start way back at the beginning and work through the series - you won't be disappointed! Not only does Nathan deliver intriguing hard science, but the situations into which he places his characters are model studies of human behaviour (and even management science)... not to mention the few culinary tips I've picked up along the way!<br /><br />Here's the series (so far) in it's entirety:<ul><li><a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/quarter-share/">Quarter Share</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/half-share/">Half Share</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/full-share/">Full Share</a></li><br /><li>(an interlude [side story] <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/south-coast/">South Coast</a>)</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/captains-share/">Captain's Share</a></li></ul><br />All of these stories are wonderfully available for free download in audio format from <a href="http://podiobooks.com">podiobooks.com</a>: read by the author in an utterly engaging way that only the creator could muster.<br /><br />When I say "so far" I really mean it: Nathan Lowell has created an alternate universe/future so compelling and detailed that I can imagine (and eagerly await) many more stories drawing from the rich canvas he has created. So many more possibilities than even the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises ... and probably more in the league of the Dune and Foundation sagas ...

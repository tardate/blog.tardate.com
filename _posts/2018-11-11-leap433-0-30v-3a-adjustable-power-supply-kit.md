The 0-30V/3A Adjustable Power Supply Kit at the heart of this build will no doubt be instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with
the usual online electronics market places.
It features continuously variable output voltage, and a variable current limit with overcurrent indicator/shutdown.

It appears the curciot design may have originated from [SmartKit](https://www.smartkit.gr/stabilised-power-supply-0-30v-3a-m.html) in Greece,
been improved by [various people](http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/0-30-vdc-stabilized-power-supply-with-current-control-0-002-3-a/),
and at some point the "canonical design" was picked up for mass production (instantly identifiable by the red PCB and tall cap).

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

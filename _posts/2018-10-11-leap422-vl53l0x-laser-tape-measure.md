The [VL53L0X](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l0x.html)
is a very small Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging sensor.
It is quite widely available as a module, including from Adafruit - see their [information page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl53l0x-micro-lidar-distance-sensor-breakout/downloads).

For this project I'm taking the module for a test drive and building a short-range tape measure with an Arduino and Nokia 5110 display.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">Living in Singapore, I first came across <strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong> on <a href="http://www.asianfoodchannel.com/">afc</a>. I had no idea who this loud mouth git was. <br /><br />But <strong>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</strong> soon got me hooked. Once you get past his confronting style, you start to realise there is real passion, concern and intelligence behind the bluster. And he seems to do a damn good job of turning places around on a dime.<br /><br />On a whim, I picked up <strong>Gordon Ramsay - The Biography</strong> in the library. Got me suckered in very quickly and I tore through it in a day. The story behind the man is well told, and gives an idea of where the driven, hard-swearing and uncompromising character comes from. And why you should not be surprised that he is at heart a loving family guy with a wicked sense of humour and love for life... and be not a little bit impressed with all he has achieved along the way.<br /><br />You may not agree that Ramsay's way is the best or only way to run a kitchen or a business, but he proves that it certainly is <em>a</em> way - and one that has worked for him.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=1844543811&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table>

Living in Singapore, I first came across <strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong> on <a href=
"http://www.asianfoodchannel.com/">afc</a>. I had no idea who this loud mouth git was.<br>
<br>
But <strong>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</strong> soon got me hooked. Once you get past his confronting style,
you start to realise there is real passion, concern and intelligence behind the bluster. And he seems to do a
damn good job of turning places around on a dime.<br>
<br>
On a whim, I picked up
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/610512.Gordon_Ramsay" class="book-title">Gordon Ramsay - The Biography</a>
in the library. Got me suckered in very
quickly and I tore through it in a day. The story behind the man is well told, and gives an idea of where the
driven, hard-swearing and uncompromising character comes from. And why you should not be surprised that he is
at heart a loving family guy with a wicked sense of humour and love for life... and be not a little bit
impressed with all he has achieved along the way.<br>
<br>
You may not agree that Ramsay's way is the best or only way to run a kitchen or a business, but he proves that
it certainly is <em>a</em> way - and one that has worked for him.

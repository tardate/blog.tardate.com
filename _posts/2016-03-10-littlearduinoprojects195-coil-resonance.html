I've been trying to do some RF experiments, but instead being driven mad by hand-wound coils that never seem to behave as the <a href="http://www.66pacific.com/calculators/coil_calc.aspx">standard coil inductance calculations</a> would lead us to believe.<br /><br />As always, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff5xOENID7w">w2aew to the rescue with a neat deconstruction and demo of a circuit for coil or inductor measurement</a>.<br /> <br />I built the circuit out, and was easily measuring down to 10µH on a breadboard, and sub-1µH once I put the circuit on a hacked up copper board with islands. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit">LC circuit resonant frequency formula</a>, it's possible to work backwards from known frequency and capacitance to determine the inductance (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%2F+%28+150pF+*+%282%CF%80+*+12.608MHz%29%5E2+%29">wolframalpha is great for this</a>). <br /><br />So now I hope to get back into some RF without the nagging doubt of not really knowing what my coils are doing!<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/LCResonator">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br />Here's a beautiful trace of a (nominally) 10µH choke with a 150pF capacitor. I measure the frequency at 4.26MHz, therefore an actual inductance of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%2F+%28+150pF+*+%282%CF%80+*+4.26MHz%29^2+%29">9.3µH</a> .. pretty close!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/LCResonator" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/LCResonator/assets/scope_pcb10uh150pf.gif?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div><br />Even with a super-bodgy 4.5 turn coil whipped up on the spot and put in parallel with a 30pF capacitor, I'm still getting a decent oscillation at 34.09MHz for a calculated inductance of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%2F+%28+30pF+*+%282%CF%80+*+34.09MHz%29^2+%29">0.73µH</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/LCResonator" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/LCResonator/assets/scope_pcbL1h30pf.gif?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div><br />And here's the board delivering the results:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/LCResonator" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/LCResonator/assets/LCResonator_build.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

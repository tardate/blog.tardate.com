The big news in the enterprise over the past week has of course been <a href=
"http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9792531-7.html">SAP's aquisition of Business Objects</a>. While this definitely marks
another major milestone in the consolidation of the BI industry, there's <a href=
"http://www.rittmanmead.com/2007/10/08/sap-to-buy-business-objects/">some questioning</a> on just how important this
will prove to be in the long term.<br>
<br>
My personal feeling is that in a few years we may look back and realise that all the BI news obscured the real story of
the day ... James Governor's post on <a href=
"http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/10/10/mashing-up-sap-teched-07-munich-driving-accidental-awesomeness/">Mashing
up SAP</a> may appear to be an innocent conference write-up, but could be seen as one of the early shots fired in the
ultimate battle between SAP and Oracle for the <a href=
"http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/10/08/redmonktv-the-rise-of-the-designerdeveloper-mashup-developer/">enterprise
developer</a> (dressed up as "Enterprise Mashups" or "Enterprise 2.0" if you wish).<br>
<br>
I'm expecting this to be a key battleground over the next couple of years. By 2009, we'll begin to see full convergence
of the *2.0/RIA trend along with the componentisation/service-enablement of the ERP suites (call it SOA or SCA). This
will herald a new era of enterprise development, where customers will expect to buy and configure standard software
components from Oracle/SAP, but then deploy for use within highly tailored and personalised "user-interaction
environments" (web pages or portals in today's terminology, but on steroids).<br>
<br>
If this is the future, then the application back-end risks commoditisation and the <strong>vendor that owns the hearts
and minds of the enterprise development community will take the crown</strong>. And SIs who make their bacon
implementing enterprise applications have had their warning: one day soon you will wake up and the world will have
changed. <em>Not ready? Sorry, you're out of business.</em><br>
<br>
In this context, Web 2.0 has just been a warm-up lap for <a href=
"/2007/09/soaenterprise-20-rebel-alliance-takes.html">taking on the enterprise</a>.<br>
<br>
We can see the battle lines being drawn. I think the <a href=
"http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/partners/sap.html">Adobe-SAP partnership</a>, which has been getting a lot of <a href=
"http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/10/02/sap-teched-07-communityday-whos-hungry-whos-burping/">positive press</a> of
late, may go down in history as way more significant than BO. Events like RedMonk's <a href=
"http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/10/10/next-week-sap-teched-07-in-munich-wordpress-erp-and-lord-knows-what/">enterprise
mashup track</a> at the upcoming SAP TechEd in Munich continue to highlight their embrace of the rich internet
application development community.<br>
<br>
I like their theme ... "driving accidental awesomeness" ... <em>the future is already here, itâ€™s just unevenly
distributed (<a href="http://www.schipul.com/en/q/?2658">William Gibson</a>)</em>.<br>
<br>
Of course, Oracle has not been silent. One could even argue that just like the Hyperion acquisition prompted SAP to
move on BO, it was Oracle's vision for Fusion Applications got the ball rolling in the first place. As I've <a href=
"/2007/07/fellow-travellers-on-road-to-fusion.html">blogged before</a> though, Oracle <em>appears</em> to be a little
slow to embrace the implications for enterprise developers ... that is, until <a href=
"http://oracleappslab.com/2007/09/06/too-busy-to-innovate/trackback/">Oracle AppsLab</a> hit the scene.<br>
<br>
Oracle has done a great deal to attract diverse developer audiences (from <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/php/index.html">PHP</a> to <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/dotnet/index.html">.NET</a> to an interesting category of <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/scripting-languages/index.html">"non-PHP scripting languages"</a>), but this is
generally not applications-related. Of course it's own application development strategy currently remains firmly
committed to Java and ADF in particular. What will be most interesting is how we see Oracle incorporate the needs of
(non-ADF) "mashup" developers as Fusion Applications become concrete.<br>
<br>
So in one sense it appears Oracle and SAP are pursuing diametrically opposed strategies - SAP hunting for communities
to "adopt" and build (like Adobe), whereas the Oracle approach is perhaps a bit more like "build it well, and they will
come". It will be interesting to watch this one play out ...

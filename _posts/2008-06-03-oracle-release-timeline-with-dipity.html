Derek Dukes was on <a href="http://twit.tv/natn52">net@nite #53</a> the other week, and it was really interesting to hear him talk about <a href="http://www.dipity.com">dipity</a>.<br /><br />Dipity is an experiment in information organisation, with time being the primary dimension currently being explored. Similar in a way to MIT's <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">SMILE</a> widget, which I was investigating a while back for visualizing time-based information.<br /><br />Dipity shows a great deal of promise, and I like its emphasis on self-discovery and organisation information if directed (rather than everything having to be painstakingly entered).  It is certainly a fun way to get lost for a few hours and learn a whole lot of stuff you never set out to study (just go to the home page and start checking out different timelines!)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dipity.com/user/ugb">Ulrich</a> has already worked up a <a href="http://www.dipity.com/user/ugb/timeline/Oracle_New_Downloads">history of Oracle Releases</a>. Not complete, but a fantastic visualisation that would be worth supporting and maintaining!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">NB: I'm posting a static image here for now, because the embed code doesn't seem to work in all browsers at the moment.</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.dipity.com/user/ugb/timeline/Oracle_New_Downloads"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SEUhmfA2kLI/AAAAAAAAAVo/J5AKyYYvVjE/s400/dipity-oracle-downloads.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5207605489167667378" /></a><br /><!--script src="http://www.dipity.com/user/ugb/timeline/Oracle_New_Downloads/embed"></script-->

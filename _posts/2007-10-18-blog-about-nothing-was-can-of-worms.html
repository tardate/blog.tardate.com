<a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2007/10/15/a-can-of-worms/trackback/">Jake is right</a> .. this is getting a little
too much like Seinfeld.<br>
<br>

"http://blogs.zdnet.com/Howlett/wp-trackback.php?p=201">posts</a> about <a href=
"http://oracleappslab.com/2007/10/15/a-can-of-worms/trackback/">bloggers at OpenWorld</a>.<br>
<br>
Seems to me a storm in a teacup (admittedly, roughly the same size as a can of worms, but probably shouldn't be
confused - print picture on right for easy reference). Most of it driven by a comparison to what "other" companies
do.<br>
<br>
As an avid blog <em>reader</em>, I'm actually more interested in an intelligent post from someone who has taken some
time to reflect and write about their <em>usage</em> of the software (be it from a project, production or just playing
with an <a href="http://otn.oracle.com">OTN</a> download).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I definitely see value in blogging from OpenWorld - as much for the <strong>community buzz</strong>
as discussion of the latest and greatest OpenWorld news. But to put too much emphasis on this I think actually plays
<em>into</em> the hands of the supposed PR and Marketing heavies (everything focused around a single, well orchestrated
event).<br>
<br>
Since I also represent a "global audience" (living in Singapore), there's also the geographic factor. Notwithstanding
whether travel costs are reimbursed, I never expect an event centred around a single location in the US to fully
represent the diversity of the blogging community I'm so comfortable with.<br>
<br>
As such, I'd be even more impressed if we saw OTN podcasts evolve into a more interactive channel (e.g. using <a href=
"http://www.talkshoe.com/">talkshoe</a> a la <a href="http://www.twit.tv/natn">net@nite</a>) to give true, open access
for the community to key execs (and then blog about it).<br>
<br>
Then there is the question of disclosure. Mary Ann Davidson just posted a <a href=
"http://blogs.oracle.com/maryanndavidson/2007/10/17">poignant discussion</a> of disclosure. Although arrowed at a
security audience, the timing is perfect for the opening of Jake's can of worms;-)<br>
<br>
I just can't seem to get myself worked up over this either. Perhaps something I drank last night? Or perhaps I've just
got a bit more faith in the sophistication of the audience that is now growing up with blogging et al. Two factors:
influence (declared or not) stands out like a sore thumb (or else why is it so easy to recognise the executive blogs
that are straight out of the marketing playbook). Second, thanks to the magic of RSS I'm not just listening to one
person's voice.<br>
<br>
So all in all, I reckon getting free registration is a pretty good first step (despite the fact that other companies
may do more for you). It's not like the information won't be available for all to see and share after the show, so if
you want the prestige of having the first blog post up on a particular subject maybe paying some of your own way ain't
such a bad deal.<br>
<br>
I would make one concession however: I do think it would be in Oracle and the community's best interest for Oracle to
have some flexibility when it comes to the (very) few bloggers who have truely crossed the line and are in fact
analyst/press and should thus be treated as such.<br>
<br>
So much for my post about nothing;-)<br>
<br>
<em>Disclosure: since I work at Oracle, I never expected a blogger invite (and I wasn't able to wangle an employee
seat), so perhaps that explains my disinterest in getting all het up about the issue!</em>

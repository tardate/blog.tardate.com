9th July 2010: lazy morning before jumping on the train to Mitaka and from there a short walk through the suburban
backstreets to the <a href="http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/">Ghibli Museum</a> - the showcase for the work of Hayao
Miyazaki and his <a href="http://www.ghibli.jp/">スタジオジブリ - STUDIO GHIBLI</a>.<br>
<br>
I've always wanted to visit, but discovered on past trips that tickets are extremely hard to obtain! There are some
<a href="http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket_information/">international ticket agents</a>, but most of us need to
buy at a Lawson's outlet once in Japan. The problem is that unless you are in Japan for some time, the odds being able
to get tickets at Lawson's are not good .. and you also need to struggle with a Japanese touch-screen system;-)
Luckily, this trip I was able to get my Uncle to buy tickets in advance.<br>

<br>
The museum is one of the very best I've ever visited. I <span style="font-weight:bold;">absolutely</span> recommend you
put it on your itinerary when visiting Japan!<br>
<br>
Whether you are a Miyazaki fan or not, this place can't fail to enthrall. The exhibits are fascinating, many using
stroboscopic effects to produce live animation. All have clearly been designed, constructed, and maintained with loving
care. This is not your typical <span style=
"font-style:italic;">two-blocks-of-wood-knocked-together-by-a-work-experience-student-and-probably-not-working-today</span>
kind of museum.<br>

<br>
There are many hours to be enjoyably lost simply browsing the huge collection of paraphernalia from Miyazaki's life and
work - sketches, paintings storyboards, models, research folios, books, books and more books.<br>

Although Totoro is perhaps the most widely-known character created by STUDIO
GHIBLI, I think Porco Rosso remains my favourite film of all. What's not to like in a movie about a seaplane-flying pig
who fight's off air pirates and rediscovers his secret love?<br>

Walking back to catch the train from Kichijōji turned out to be a good choice; found lots of places for a late lunch
near the station. I must have had pigs on my mind, since we ended up at Tare-Katsu where they soak the katsu medallions
in lovely brown sauce straight after frying. Yum! Note what they stamp on your loyalty card;-)<br>

Blinking an LED is a pretty mundane test for the beautiful BoldportClub Cuttle.
For something more interesting (if not useful!) I decided to get it to write it's name on a digital oscilloscope.
The X-Y scope inputs are controlled with an MCP42010 digital potentiometer.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

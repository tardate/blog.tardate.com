A collegue and I have been looking at a setup with completely separate Oracle Portal (with SSO) and Oracle Collabsuite
installations, and we wanted a simple way to have users automatically logged into Collabsuite after logging into
Portal. If you are not familiar with Collabsuite, just think "J2EE" application.<br>
<br>
Normally you would deploy a consolidated infrastructure, which makes this a no-brainer, but for various reasons we
wanted to keep these two environments quite separate.<br>
<br>
The details of how we did this are not really pertinent, but the bottom line is that we had everything sorted with one
exception: the LDAP realm on Portal did not match Collabsuite. Everything was nicely working except the Collabsuite web
applications keeled over, because the "osso-user-dn" request header set by the Portal SSO did not match
Collabsuite.<br>
<br>
If only we could hack/rewrite the osso-user-dn to fixup the realm part!<br>
<br>
Now with Apache 2.0, this is probably quite easy by using the RequestHeaders directive in httpd.conf. That didn't exist
in Apache 1.3, which unfortunately is what we are using.<br>
<br>
This lead me to investigate what could be done at the J2EE level, and I discovered for the first time the servlet
filter features in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet API 2.3</a>.<br>
<br>
There are a few good tutorials floating around the web, such as Jason Hunter's <a href=
"http://www.servlets.com/soapbox/filters.html">JavaWorld</a> article, but nothing I've found yet specifically
demonstrates header rewrite.<br>
<br>
Its pretty simple though. I've put together a demo RewriteRequestHeaderFilter with sources (download: <a href=
"http://github.com/tardate/sources/tree/master/RewriteRequestHeaderFilter-1.0-src.zip?raw=true">RewriteRequestHeaderFilter-1.0-src.zip</a>).
It contains a complete demo site, but is also packaged and ready to insert into any arbitrary web application (just
deploy the jar and fiddle the site's web.xml).<br>
<br>
So, if you ever find yourself wanting to fiddle request headers in the J2EE environment and don't have "external"
options, the RewriteRequestHeaderFilter could be just the ticket.<br>

"http://sourceforge.net/projects/rewriteheaders/">sourceforge project</a> now.</span>

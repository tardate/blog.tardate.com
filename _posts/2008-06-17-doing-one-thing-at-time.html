<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/">James Shore</a> discussed Agile Release Planning on <a href="http://community.featureplan.com/community/2008/06/webinar_june_11_1200pm_edt_max.php">this recent PM podcast</a>, and it was refreshing to hear the benefits of agile pitched to a product management audience.<br /><br />Like the best ideas, the tenets of agile appear almost too simple to be true. <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Master of the bleeding obvious" Basil Fawlty would say.</span> Yet most organisations seem structurally incapable of behaving along these lines.<br /><br />James' presentation is very entertaining, and well worth a listen. He keeps the agenda short and well tuned to a PM audience. Although the ideas are born from a software environment, they are largely transferable to other domains. A discussion of five concepts to help you increase the value you deliver in business:<br /><ul><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Work on one project at a time</span> .. it improves your ROI</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Release early and often</span> .. get to market faster with a minimum, but valuable feature-set. Not only do you get to take advantage of the real customer voice sooner, but, again, better ROI.</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Adapt your plans</span> .. to slavishly avoid change is to confound the opportunity to increase the value of your work as new things are learned along the way</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conduct experiments</span> .. your project can have many outcomes, and you will never know which is best unless you test options, collect data, and analyse</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Plan at the last responsible moment</span> .. avoid costly planning that is basically trying to predict the future (unsuccessfully). The later the decision, the more information you will have available to make a good decision.</li><br /></ul>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">one project at a time</span> struck a chord with me, as I've recently been campaigning in a minor way along these lines. The classic "proof" is the positive impact it can have on ROI if you allow appropriately sized teams to focus on one thing at a time. This is of course in addition to any productivity benefits you get from avoiding task switching, and giving people the chance to get into a flow state.<br /><br />Here's my version of the graphic to illustrate the point:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SFXr9koHmBI/AAAAAAAAAWY/yNn3s-wPHSY/s1600-h/agile-release-planning2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SFXr9koHmBI/AAAAAAAAAWY/yNn3s-wPHSY/s400/agile-release-planning2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212331586787710994" /></a>

The Hartley oscillator is distinguished by a tapped inductor to provide feedback (the Colpitts oscillator uses capacitors).

I got some decent results on a breadboard, even better on protoboard, using a basic Hertley design with RF chokes for inductors and a BJT.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

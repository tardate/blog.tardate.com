After reading <a href="/2007/07/tipping-point.html">The Tipping Point</a>,
I realised <a href="https://amzn.to/4ni194W" class="book-title">blink</a>
was also by Malcolm Gladwell so I picked it up at the first opportunity.<br>
<br>
If anything, I found <strong>blink</strong> even more engaging and interesting than The Tipping Point. It
explores and tries to explain what happens in those first microseconds of automatic insight. Even more
challenging is the question of whether you can harness and train this "power of thinking without thinking" ...

I've come across a few occasions where I wanted to specify a "range parameter" for Bash scripts. Like "1..4" meaning do
for 1,2,3 and 4.<br>
<br>
Here's a simple trick that uses the (relatively obscure) variable expansion and substring replacement capabilities of
the shell.<br>
<pre name="code" class="sql:wraplines:nocontrols">
#!/bin/bash<br>v_range="1..3"         # or you could have taken it as a script parameter<br>v_start=${v_range%%.*} # chomp everything from the left-most matching "."<br>v_end=${v_range##*.}   # chomp everything up to the right-most matching "."
</pre><br>
The repeated %% and ## basically mean you will get a "greedy" match, so you can say "1..4" or "1....5"; it doesn't
matter how many repeats you have of the range delimiter. Of course, you can choose other delimiters such as a hyphen,
as in "5-10", if you wish.<br>
<br>
Now that you have extracted the start and end indices, you can then loop or whatever to your hearts content:<br>
<pre name="code" class="sql:wraplines:nocontrols">
for ((a=v_start; a &lt;= v_end ; a++))<br>do<br>   echo "Looping with a=$a"<br>done
</pre><br>
For more information on variable expansion, see 9.3 in the <a href=

<br>
<em>Postscript 5-Feb-2008:</em><br>
We live and learn! Hat tip to buford for alerting me to the <span class="code">seq</span> utility, which simplifies the
iteration over a range, as in:<br>
<pre name="code" class="sql:wraplines:nocontrols">
for a in `seq 1 10`<br>do<br>  echo "Looping with a=$a"<br>done <br>
</pre><br>
You still need to determine the start and end values of the range, which is the whole point of the variable expansions
approach posted here.

        The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell is one of those books that you suddenly realise is everywhere -
        bookshops, airports, being read by people on the bus or train.<br>
        <br>
        It's an easy and engaging read - Gladwell's a compelling story teller - and does a convincing job of exploring
        and explaining just how social epidemics work. He uses a simple model of three concepts to organise the
        book:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The Law of the Few : Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>The Stickiness Factor
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>The Power of Context
          </li>
        </ul>I found myself immediately reflecting on how this all applies to what I am trying to achieve at work. I'm
        sure every reader will do a similar thing - whether your mission is to nurture an idea, a product or a
        message.<br>
        <br>
        In one of his case studies, Gladwell even makes a very convincing argument for why public health policy has got
        it completely wrong in regard to controlling smoking!

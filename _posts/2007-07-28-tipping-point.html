<a href="https://amzn.to/3ZOa3gu" class="book-title">The Tipping Point</a> by Malcolm Gladwell is one of those books that you suddenly realise is everywhere -
bookshops, airports, being read by people on the bus or train.<br>
<br>
It's an easy and engaging read - Gladwell is a compelling story teller - and does a convincing job of exploring
and explaining just how social epidemics work. He uses a simple model of three concepts to organise the
book:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Law of the Few : Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Stickiness Factor
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Power of Context
  </li>
</ul>I found myself immediately reflecting on how this all applies to what I am trying to achieve at work. I'm
sure every reader will do a similar thing - whether your mission is to nurture an idea, a product or a
message.<br>
<br>
In one of his case studies, Gladwell even makes a very convincing argument for why public health policy has got
it completely wrong in regard to controlling smoking!

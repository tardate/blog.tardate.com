But this last weekend, they stormed Fort Canning Park for a <strong>huge</strong> crowd.<br /><br />Although the band I saw (Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Vinny Appice) go under the <strong>Heaven and Hell</strong> name to distinguish from the Ozzy version of the band, this is classic Sabbath. As good or better than a flashback to the <strong>Live Evil</strong> tour.<br /><br />I don't think Singapore will see such a brilliant live act for a long time yet. Flawless playing by all, Iommi just magic, Dio as good as ever .. I think they blew the doors of the clubroom at the back of the park. <br /><br />And the crowd loved it. Any hard rock act that thinks Singapore isn't worth the effort betta check with Dio or Megadeth (who played the night before). <br /><br />Here's my crap concert photo. I took some video too, but the audio track is useless -the band was pumping out about 100,000 watts too much power for my poor handphone mike!<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RyUUSd0fZ6I/AAAAAAAAAL8/oMbDISOwRx4/s1600-h/heaven-hell-2007.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RyUUSd0fZ6I/AAAAAAAAAL8/oMbDISOwRx4/s400/heaven-hell-2007.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5126526058306168738" /></a><br /><em>Thanks to Aat for telling me about the concert and getting the tixs..</em><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">16th May 2010 - rumours that Ronnie James Dio succumbed to cancer, but <a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140115">it seems he fights on</a>. </span>

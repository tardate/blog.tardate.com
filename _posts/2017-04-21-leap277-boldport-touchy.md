Touchy is a capacitive-touch input device with on-board Sleepy Bee microcontroller (Boldport Club Project #7).
No disappointments here - another beautiful board to add to my growing collection of club projects,
and a little challenge to hand-solder the EFM8SB1 processor with its insane QSOP 0.625mm pin pitch!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

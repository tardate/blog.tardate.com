<em>Mmm .. getting back to the original theme of this blog: prata reports!</em><br>
<br>
On Saturday I stopped off at Suntec Convention Centre. It's had a famous prata stall for years, and it seems to have
survived last year's renovation under the "Food Republic" brand (look for the <strong>What You Do Prata</strong>
stall). Pleased to report the plain prata is as light and fluffy as ever with just enough crispyness. Curry is not bad,
but more like a thicker masala style. For fun (and your sweet-tooth), try the prata tissue!<br>

NB: many places you'll find the Teh Tarik is bitter and stewed. Not here .. its great!

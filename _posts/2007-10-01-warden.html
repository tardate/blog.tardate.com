<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I've had <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/975/000084723/">Anthony Trollope</a>'s <strong>The Warden</strong> in my iPod for a while, and finally listened to it last week. This is the <a href="http://librivox.org/the-warden-by-anthony-trollope/">LibriVox</a> recording of the 1855 novel.<br /><br />It's a great story that deals in part with the unexpected ethical dilemmas that often attend foolhardy idealistic pursuits. A nice dab of dry wit, to whit:<br /><blockquote class="quote">..but in matters of love men do not see clearly in their own affairs. They say that faint heart never won fair lady; and it is amazing to me how fair ladies are won, so faint are often men's hearts! Were it not for the kindness of their nature, that seeing the weakness of our courage they will occasionally descend from their impregnable fortresses, and themselves aid us in effecting their own defeat, too often would they escape unconquered if not unscathed, and free of body if not of heart.</blockquote><br />I couldn't help thinking that if you notch up the drama a bit and don't take it too litterally, the story would make a great "romantic-comedy-drama" movie. I can't dislodge a feeling that there's a stuffy British 1950's B&W version, but I can't find a reference to it. I did discover that there's a BBC series of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065GX96?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00065GX96">The Barchester Chronicles</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00065GX96" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> from 1982 with Donald Pleasence playing Rev. Septimus Harding (perfect casting). <strong>The Warden</strong> is one novel in the series. <br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0812967046&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B00065GX96&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

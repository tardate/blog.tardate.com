        I picked out Rob Shein's <a href=
        "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931836094?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1931836094">
        Zero Day Exploit: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)</a><img src=
        "https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1931836094" width="1" height="1"
        border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"> at the library simply because it
        stuck out as an obvious "computer book" in the fiction section. I thought it had been mis-shelved and so it
        caught my eye.<br>
        <br>
        I finished reading it because ... well, it is simply so bad as to have a kind of <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_D._Wood,_Jr.">Ed Wood</a> "B-movie" allure.<br>
        <br>
        It is a pity, because the idea has promise: a fictionalised cyber-security thriller that can almost double as a
        vulnerability assessment and computer forensics text because of the detail it includes.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, the book would be better titled <span style="font-weight:bold;">Zero Day FAIL!</span><br>
        <br>
        In terms of the computer security technicalities, it is really light weight, making only cursory reference to
        just a few of the most routine security issues and tools, and describing a methodology that is far from leading
        practice. The author's main characters are meant to be save-the-world "white hat" geniuses, but they come
        across as bumbling script-kiddie amateurs. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Stuck debugging a program because
        they mis-spelt "main"? Forgot there might be a firewall in place? Found a vulnerability on the first attempt by
        sending a stream of Ã‰, "because it is a character know to cause buffer overflows". Sheesh!</span>

</table>As a novel, I don't think I've ever read a book so in need of a good editor than this. Just about every aspect
needs work or a complete re-write: character development; dialogue; story arc; climax and resolution.<br>
<br>
And did I mention the plot? It goes from sublime to the ridiculous, and then just peters away..<br>
<br>
Mind you, even well-known authors can fall into the "sublime to the ridiculous" plot trap. Take Eric Van Lustbader for
example, writing <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446539872?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=itsaprli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446539872">
Robert Ludlum's (TM) The Bourne Sanction</a><img src=
"https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0446539872" width="1" height="1" border="0"
alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">. Whereas Ludlum was a true master at pulling together
incredibly complex and outlandish plots while never for a moment losing the credulity of his audience, Van Lustbader
always seems to miss the mark by a little. And as a reader, once you start questioning the realism of characters'
behaviour and the uncanny role of coincidences, then the magic of the story is quickly extinguished and the author has
lost you.<br>
<br>
I mention The Bourne Sanction for one further reason: like Zero Day Exploit, it features terrorists attempting to
distroy the petroleum distribution infrastructure of the US. <span style="font-weight:bold;">And the one thing that Rob
Shein should feel happy about is that his scenario for how this could be done is way more credible than what Van
Lustbader cooked up for The Bourne Sanction</span> (which made me think Van Lustbader was probably script-consulting on

height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"> at the time)<br>
<br>
So was Zero Day Exploit mis-shelved? You bet. They missed the bin by a mile!

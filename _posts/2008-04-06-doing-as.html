Had some work on the weekend, so I've had my iPod on "song play". So far it's at 144 of 4981 and still working through
the "A"s. I'm up to <span style="font-style:italic;">Always..</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/4l3qo9I" class="book-title">Always</a> - Bon Jovi,
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3HXLMye" class="book-title">Bounce</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Always</span> by <a href="http://www.mai-kuraki.com/">Kuraki Mai</a> 倉木麻衣 from
    <a href="https://amzn.to/4lsh3Ih" class="book-title">Fever Pitch: Official 2002 Fifa World Cup</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/4njlPt4" class="book-title">Always On The Run [Explicit]</a> Lenny Kravitz
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3HYx0Yb" class="book-title">Greatest Hits</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Always The Way</span> - James Reyne from his cool 80's pop-rock
    <a href="https://amzn.to/44fVL9P" class="book-title">self titled</a>, the first album he
    released after leaving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crawl">Australian Crawl</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/43XrGNg" class="book-title">Always With Me, Always With You</a> - classic melody line by Joe Satriani from
    <a href="https://amzn.to/4k5HnXy" class="book-title">Surfing with the Alien</a>
  </li>
</ul><br>
Best song in the "Always" category? At the moment, my vote's going to Kuraki Mai. And like pretty much everything these
days, it's on YouTube too, complete with user-generated anime mtv;-)<br>

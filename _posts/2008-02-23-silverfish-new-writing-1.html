<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><span style="font-weight:bold;">New Writing</span> was published in 2001 by <a href="http://silverfishbooks.com">silverfishbooks</a>. It is a collection of works in English by writers from around Singapore and Malaysia. <br /><br />At the time it was quite a risky business proposition. Was anyone going to buy a book like this? Mainstream sentiment was generally quite negative towards works in English (either because the national languages held more prestige, or a perverse expectation that local writers by definition couldn't be any good if they used English). <br /><br />Well, with six editions now in print, I think the critics have been silenced and the series has I think given the local writing scene more self-confidence.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R8DGeG1WWTI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PDbEin6znhQ/s1600-h/silverfish-new-writing-1.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width:160px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/R8DGeG1WWTI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PDbEin6znhQ/s320/silverfish-new-writing-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170350592754080050" /></a>I recently went back to read some of the stories in the first edition. I like the little sketches of life. Either contemporary such as Hong Wee's <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Drive Home</span>, or reminiscing on the past as in <span style="font-weight:bold;">14 Leech Street</span> by Bernice Chauly. <br /><br />Of course must pay homage to the local fascination with ghost and zombie stories with Kaysidayat bin Ishak's <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Last Train</span>. Or something a little more tender and juicily experimental like <span style="font-weight:bold;">Plat du Jour</span> by Muslin Abdul Hamid.<br /><br />And much more. Pick any book in this series to try something new and different. Its a bit like nasi padang - get to sample a whole range of small dishes with great local flavour.</td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=983408160X&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table>

<a href="https://amzn.to/3T5BpuP" class="book-title">New Writing</a>
was published in 2001 by <a href=
"http://silverfishbooks.com">silverfishbooks</a>. It is a collection of works in English by writers from around
Singapore and Malaysia.<br>
<br>
At the time it was quite a risky business proposition. Was anyone going to buy a book like this? Mainstream
sentiment was generally quite negative towards works in English (either because the national languages held
more prestige, or a perverse expectation that local writers by definition couldn't be any good if they used
English).<br>
<br>
Well, with six editions now in print, I think the critics have been silenced and the series has I think given
the local writing scene more self-confidence.<br>

recently went back to read some of the stories in the first edition. I like the little sketches of life. Either
contemporary such as Hong Wee's <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Drive Home</span>, or reminiscing on the
past as in <span style="font-weight:bold;">14 Leech Street</span> by Bernice Chauly.<br>
<br>
Of course must pay homage to the local fascination with ghost and zombie stories with Kaysidayat bin Ishak's
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Last Train</span>. Or something a little more tender and juicily
experimental like <span style="font-weight:bold;">Plat du Jour</span> by Muslin Abdul Hamid.<br>
<br>
And much more. Pick any book in this series to try something new and different. Its a bit like nasi padang -
get to sample a whole range of small dishes with great local flavour.

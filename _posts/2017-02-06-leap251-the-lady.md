A fine specimen of Coccinellidae Boldportus, a new type of ladybird discovered in Bermondsey, London.
"The Lady" is Project #4 from The Boldport Club. It is a really simple circuit, and functionally nothing ground-breaking ..
but that really isn't the point. It is just a stunning bit of PCB design. Yes, this is more art than electronics!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

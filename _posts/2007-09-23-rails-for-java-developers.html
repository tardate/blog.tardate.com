I've picked up and put down quote a few Ruby and Rails books, but haven't found anything that really captured
me. That is, until
<a href="https://amzn.to/3Ic7Jtr" class="book-title">Rails for Java Developers</a>. The discussion is intelligent, and the
comparisons between Java and Rails approaches is a great learning process. Thankfully, it doesn't get into
slamming one or the other but just focuses on the <em>how</em>. I've worked through some parts of the book so
far (my Rails learning is not exactly on the fast track yet!), but I can <strong>definitely recommended it if
you have the Java background</strong>.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3TaUOuh" class="book-title">Ruby on Rails for Dummies</a>, on the other hand,
simply reinforces my dislike of the whole <em>Dummies</em> idea.
I'm not against straight-to-the-point beginner texts (on the contrary, that's what I was
looking for!) but this books suffers the worst of two blights:<br>
<ul>
  <li>It <em>doesn't</em> get straight to the point. Only so many cutesy, hip analogies and stories I can deal
  with.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>It lays a limited and 'closed' foundation of knowledge. For example, it takes you through project
  configuration with an IDE but never hints there is another way. Fine if you never want to go beyond the
  basics that you get spoon fed here, but if you have higher ambitions at some point you'll have to
  unlearn/relearn all of the fundamentals you learn here. I hate that. By all means teach me grade 1, but help
  me build a mental model that can accommodate grade 2,3 and beyond at the same time.
  </li>
</ul>Give this a wide berth.<br>

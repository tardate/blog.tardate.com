Just a quick note to highlight a relatively new enhancement to blogspot .. the ability to get an RSS feed for a given label. I stumbled across the <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=53336&topic=10275">instructions</a> while trying to figure out how to get a feed of all the book reviews I decided to put up at my <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/">Prata Life</a> blog. The basic URL formulation is like this:<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"><pre>http://blogname.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/-/labelname<br />e.g. my reading feed is:<br />http://pratalife.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/-/Read<br /></pre></span></blockquote>So now I have a little side-panel on the <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com">tardate</a> blog showing the most recent books I've read, using the RSS widget. Cool!<br /><br />Top of the list right now is <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/08/ambler-warning.html">The Ambler Warning</a> by Robert Ludlum, which had some interesting, coincidental cross-overs to other books I'd read recently (<a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/07/blink.html">blink</a>, <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/07/softwar-intimate-portrait-of-larry.html">Softwar</a>). Includes an interesting cameo(?) as the book reaches a climax, action centers on the World Economic Forum meeting at Davos..<br /><br /><blockquote><em>"A couple of yards away from him, an older, rangy American billionaire - someone whose 'enterprise software' was an industry standard across the globe..."</em> Hmmm, ring any bells? If you don't think Bill makes 'enterprise software', then I reckon it can only be one person ...</blockquote>

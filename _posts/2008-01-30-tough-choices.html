I've heard all the stories about Carly Fiorina from friends in HP - no doubt mangled, misquoted and somewhat
misogynistic. All the ills of the company were by her hand of course.<br>
<br>
Always found that a bit much to swallow, so when I saw her autobiography
<a href="https://amzn.to/3IbuHRs" class="book-title">Touch Choices</a>
on the
shelf I picked it up for a read.<br>
<br>
I came away from the book with a much greater respect for the hard yards she has done to reach the top,
although her rise to the top is a somewhat charmed path within a few large corporates. Which may explain why -
although we get only one side of the story of course - she seems to have been so blindsided in the political
maneuvers that got her ousted from HP.<br>
<br>
The book ends soon after her departure from HP, contemplating where to go next and what she really values in
life. And by then she had me won over; I think in truth a sincere, talented and hardworking person who really
cares for the people she leads.

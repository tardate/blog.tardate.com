My backblog is giving me the irits. And what's worse I join the sad club of people who thought they cleverly <a href="http://www.usefulwork.com/shark/archives/003104.html">invented a new word</a>!  <br /><blockquote class="quote"><a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/backblog">Backblog</a>  - Overflow of incidents you intend to write about on your weblog.</blockquote><br />However, perhaps I can claim backblogarrythmia as my own:<br /><blockquote class="quote">.. a disruption in the regular flow of weblog posts, often caused by overwork, booze or a new romance. Primary symptom is the backblog, which in turn can exacerbate the problem through increased levels of performance stress. Treatment: JFPS*.</blockquote><br />I used to work in a factory where I swear one of the leading hands had a personal goal of inventing a new word everyday. He'd casually call over something like "Hey, pass me the gumlicker would ya?" and take great pleasure in our confusion. He'd be mock-shocked of course at our "ignorance", and delight in explaining the word and how stupid we were for not knowing it. Crazy thing is, he'd always have a great and usually convoluted etymology.<br />  <br />He did this pretty much every day I knew him. Just an average working class bloke, with an average education. But I always secretly admired and envied his creativity with words, wondered where the inspiration came from, and whether he'd use the gift for anything more than keeping his workmates from boredom.<br /><br />Me? The only words I invent tend to arrive as serendipitous typos. Yesterday's effort:<br /><blockquote class="quote">Museover  - particularly thought-provoking and succinct tip or pop-up text that is displayed when you hover your mouse over an icon or word.</blockquote><br />恭喜发财!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Update 27-Jan: It's official: <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/museover">museover</a> and <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/backblogarrythmia">backblogarrythmia</a> are in the (pseudo)dictionary<br /></span><br /><span style="font-size:8pt">* just fucking post something</span>

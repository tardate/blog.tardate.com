The other day I <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2008/06/promote-bad-security-practice-grand.html">added my voice</a> to the call to end the perfidious practice of social networking sites requesting your email password. <br /><br />In the discussion I made an off-hand reference to a fictitious site called iHazYrCreds. Well, it's not fictitious any longer ;-) For better or worse, you can now visit <a href="http://ihazyrcreds.tardate.com/">iHazYrCreds.tardate.com</a> to find out more about the common password traps to avoid.<br /><br />I'd like to see the day when asking for an email password in order to "import contacts" is deemed totally unacceptable (and negligent professional practice). <br /><br />I would also welcome any moves by the big email providers (google, yahoo etc) to explicitly outlaw such use in their terms of service. I'm no lawyer, but I believe it is debatable whether it is already a violation. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://ihazyrcreds.tardate.com/"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SFRRrEQojKI/AAAAAAAAAWI/B1W2vwnKQsI/s400/ihazyrcreds.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5211880469094239394" /></a>

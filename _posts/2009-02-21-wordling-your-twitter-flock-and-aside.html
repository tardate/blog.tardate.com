<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> just keeps on attracting people who glob on new and interesting innovations; the latest I've seen is <a href="http://twittersheep.com">TwitterSheep</a> which does a neat wordle of your followers.<br /><br />Twitter has got to be the poster-child for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a>. By keeping things real minimalist, it not only creates the space but also the yearning for innovation - and we're seeing that in bucketloads (see also <a href="http://mrtweet.net/">MrTweet</a>; proud to say, Singapore compatriots!).<br /><br />Wordles are simple but interesting semantic analysis toys. How useful can a word frequency count be? You may see a bit of noise, but I read them as a measure of <span style="font-style:italic;">obsession</span>. <br /><br />I've been using <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">wordle.net</a> for a while to do proposal analysis. It's become a "must-do" step before submission, as the insights can be invaluable. Simply paste in the full text of your proposal, and reflect on the resulting wordle. It's better than therapy! <br /><br />What <span style="font-weight:bold;">should</span> be prominent of course are the concerns and issues that you know your client highly values. But what you will often see in your first drafts are a whole lot of words that are basically synonyms for <span style="font-weight:bold;">ME</span>!  As in: my company, our product names, our partners, our technology etc etc. <br /><br />All very well (it is a proposal after all), but just like a good conversationalist, shouldn't good proposals be at least equally weighted towards your listener's needs and desires? I think so, and wordles are quick and easy tools for sniffing out the boilerplate proposal that doesn't give a flying fig for the customer!<br /><br />Still not convinced? Well, see the wordles that Billy Cripe did of <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/fusionecm/2008/09/fun_with_wordle.html">Obama and McCain's convention speeches</a>. Thank god you voted in Obama is all I can say!<br /><blockquote class="quote"><br />What scares me is a seeing an obsession with "Country" "Americans", "fight", "war", "God" and even friggin' "nuclear", "attack" in the one wordle!!!! <br /></blockquote><br />So here's my twitter flock. Hmm, we're a pretty boring bunch!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://twittersheep.com/?tardate"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 326px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SZ_Crd5ZYZI/AAAAAAAAAjM/QDTigTDZr38/s400/tardate-twitter-sheep.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5305172938081264018" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Props to <a href="http://uniquefrequency.com/2009/02/20/what-kind-of-people-are-following-you-on-twitter/">Daryl Tay</a> for the TwitterSheep link.</span>

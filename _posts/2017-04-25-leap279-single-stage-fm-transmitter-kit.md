I picked up another FM transmitter kit because it was too cheap to ignore.
Initially transmitting slightly high on the FM band, some adjustments of the LC tank
got it down to working quite decently around 92MHz.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

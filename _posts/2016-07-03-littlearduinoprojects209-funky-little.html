I found this interesting LED display at Sim Lim Tower, and grabbed one to test. The LED unit combines 7 x 7-segment display (no decimal points) and 7 indicator LEDs (Red-Green-Yellow).<br /><br />It is marked as "72R02PHIL T9717". I have no idea what that means(!), and of course there's no sign of a datasheet on the net, so pinouts needed a bit of reverse-engineering. All in all, an interesting display unit for a combination of numerical and status display.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/playground/LedPanelDisplay72R02">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>. <br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPpyn7SVoBo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Geoffrey Grosenbach took a diversion on the Ruby on Rails podcast recently, with a fascinating two-part
interview with John Medina (<a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/john-medina">part
1</a>, <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/john-medina-conclusion">part 2</a>).<br>
<br>
Medina is a very engaging speaker, with some controversial but well researched ideas on how the brain works,
and why so many of our social conventions in school and the workplace actually conspire against optimal brain
performance. I gather its a discussion of many of the ideas from his book
<a href="https://amzn.to/3ZPzZZ8" class="book-title">Brain Rules</a>.
<br>
<br>
Well worth a listen.

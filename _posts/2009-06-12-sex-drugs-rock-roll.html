Heard that the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_%26_Drugs_%26_Rock_%26_Roll_(film)">Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll</a>has just started production. Probably shouldn't hold my breath, but I can't wait to see it.<br /><br />It's based on the life story of Ian Dury, IMHO the best lyricist/poet who ever got a gig. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_(album)">Laughter</a> was the best album I ever bought as a teenager. I still have the cassette tape at home, even though the ferrite oxide has long rusted and worn away.<br /><br />In what could turn out to be a masterful bit of casting, they have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> playing Dury in the movie. I can well imagine Serkis doing a great Dury. Having done mega-blockbusters with Peter Jackson, Andy seems to be picking up quite a number of intriguing, not-so-mainstream roles. I guess he can afford to;-)<br /><br />I also realize there's an obscure connection between Dury and Serkis. Dury is well known for having created and performed a version of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A10831727">Bus Driver's Prayer</a>, which ends with the line..<br /><blockquote class="quote">For Iver and Iver ... Crouch End</blockquote> <br />Which is - at least according to wikipedia - where Serkis now lives. So Andy is picking up from where our dear departed Ian Dury (RIP) left off...<br /><br />OK, so that's a stretch. Time to reminisce over the Blockheads and wait for the movie to come out..<br /><br />

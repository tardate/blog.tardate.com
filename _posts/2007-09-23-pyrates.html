Before Guybrush Threepwood, before Captain Jack Sparrow ... there was Captain Avery and Colonel Blood to shiver
your timbers and brace the mains'l. Avast thar!<br>

George MacDonald Fraser's
<a href="https://amzn.to/44wFaQb" class="book-title">Pyrates</a>
is a grand farce that rolls in just about every piratical
stereotype. Similar in style to his Flashman series, and I think executed almost - but not quite - as
successfully.<br>
<br>
The delicious juxtaposition in book's dedication gives you an idea of GMF's style ;-)<br>

Some time back I posted a sample and discussion of <a href="http://tardate.blogspot.com/2007/03/request-header-rewrites-with-java.html">request header rewrites with Java servlet filters</a>, and I now finally got around to setting it up with its own <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rewriteheaders/">sourceforge project</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rewriteheaders/">RewriteRequestHeaderFilter</a> is a Java servlet filter for request header rewrites according to regex rules specified in the servlet init parameters. It is packaged as a sample application and also jar that can be inserted into any arbitrary site. <br /><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rewriteheaders/"><img src="http://sflogo.sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=228549&amp;type=5" width="210" height="62" border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo" /></a>

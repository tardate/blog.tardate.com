Audio signals can be carried by any kind of connection, but there are some more commonly used standard connectors for audio applications.
I started this project folder to collect notes on the verious connectors I use or have encountered.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

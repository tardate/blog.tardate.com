<span style="font-style:italic;">Spoiler alert: not advised reading for those who can't stomach the idea of "real" food!</span><br /><br />10th July 2010: Up at 6am to sleepily jump on the train to the <a href="http://www.tsukiji-market.or.jp/tukiji_e.htm">Tsukiji Fish Market</a>, only a few stops and a short walk away.<br /><br />I knew we were going in the right direction because of all the old men with wellington boots and wicker baskets.<br /><br />Although we didn't arrive in time for the auctions, there was still fearsome activity underfoot, and a seemingly infinite selection of seafood fresh from the boat.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtVE-OG30I/AAAAAAAAB0E/L5pzrvVqQjU/s1600/Tsukiji+-+just+a+a+small+selection.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtVE-OG30I/AAAAAAAAB0E/L5pzrvVqQjU/s400/Tsukiji+-+just+a+a+small+selection.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5497581314045828930" /></a><br />The prize catch is of course the tuna. A fish may have lost it's life, but there's something terrific yet beautiful in the way it it is treated with such reverence.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtmxHlCxvI/AAAAAAAAB1g/k2jlPNDduB0/s1600/Tsukiji+Maguro+Sensei.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 398px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtmxHlCxvI/AAAAAAAAB1g/k2jlPNDduB0/s400/Tsukiji+Maguro+Sensei.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5497600764169864946" /></a><br />The true pleasure in visiting the market comes afterwards ... finding a nearby sushi restaurant to enjoy the morning's catch in the best way possible.<br /><br />The Chutoro was divine as could be expected, but the real surprise was the Kampachi which absolutely knocked my tastebuds out of the ballpark. And even weeks later the thought of the Uni+Ikura sushi immediately makes my mouth water in anticipation of the salty creaminess!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtXJSiwOyI/AAAAAAAAB0k/fa-iEr7t_BY/s1600/Tsukiji.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 283px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtXJSiwOyI/AAAAAAAAB0k/fa-iEr7t_BY/s400/Tsukiji.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5497583587243866914" /></a><br />Which leaves me with only one question: is the princely ahi and maguro tuna <span style="font-weight:bold;">in ANY way</span> related to the sad excuse for nutritious cardboard that ends up in tins on the supermarket shelves? <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtZGg0-6sI/AAAAAAAAB1A/gcAMxl2EbY0/s1600/Tuna+for+real.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 171px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/TEtZGg0-6sI/AAAAAAAAB1A/gcAMxl2EbY0/s400/Tuna+for+real.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5497585738562071234" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blogarhythm: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VRE5F6?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VRE5F6">Fresh</a> - The Lost Fingers</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">NB: I am <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2010/07/yokoso-tokyo.html">retro-blogging Tokyo</a> which is why this post is a little delayed</span>

Apparently, Joshua Block and Neal Gafter started the "Java Puzzlers" idea at Oracle Open World 2001. I wish I
was there.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, they've turned it into a <a href="https://amzn.to/4kcsd2P" class="book-title">book</a>
, and a <a href="http://javapuzzlers.com/">website</a>.<br>
<br>
If you program in Java, you <span style="font-weight:bold;">must</span> read this book. It covers the kind of
traps in your code you wouldn't even imagine could be there.<br>
<br>
I can guarantee you have written at least one of these issues into your code. And QA never caught it. And it is
out in the wild RIGHT NOW. <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrgh!!</span><br>
<br>
These days, I think (and hope) that most professional developers are relatively atuned to coding security
issues and the rise of opinionated testing methodologies (<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a>, <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">BDD</a> etc).

But this book is a real eye-opener to the range of issues that you wouldn't even think worthy of a unit test
case.<br>
<pre name="code" class="sql:wraplines:nocontrols">
public static boolean isOdd(int i) {<br>  return i % 2 == 1;<br>}
</pre>Seems like a reasonable test for odd numbers? Except it is wrong a quarter of the time.<br>
<br>
And that is just puzzle #1.<br>
<br>
The book takes you through issues with strings, loops, classes, libraries, all the way to puzzle #95, where you learn
why you shouldn't program like your brother.<br>

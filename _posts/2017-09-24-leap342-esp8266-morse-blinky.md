A quick test of the [ESP8266 core for Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino),
which brings support for ESP8266 chip to the Arduino IDE.

That means being able to write C++ sketches for the ESP8266 as easy as developing for an Arduino.

Here I'm using the most basic ESP8266 board (an ESP-01) with a sketch that blinks Morse code on the built-in LED.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

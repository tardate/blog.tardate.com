I've been seeing the LT1019 precision reference show up in a number of designs recently,
often as a reference for an ADC such as the LTC2400.
It is worth a closer look. In this example, I'm using the LT1019 as an external analog reference for an Arduino.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

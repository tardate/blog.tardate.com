The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSAF_Black_Knights">RSAF Black Knights</a> got the nod to perform at this
years National Day celebrations, which means aerobatics between the buildings in the CBD. Yeehaw!<br>
<br>

Now, I've been in Singapore long enough to know that NDP celebration preparations are taken seriously, and you never
have less than 4 practices of anything (including fireworks, to everyone's great enjoyment).<br>
<br>
So with about two months to go, its seems the RSAF have started daily practice flying around the city. From my desk on
level 56, I get a stunning view of the F-16s fly by at arms reach and then get thrown into a 180 degree climb.
Stunning.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the next two months of this. Oh, and NDP itself;-)

Access Control Rules are a very important aspect to get right when setting up Oracle Virtual Directory. But at the same
time, I guess they are probably the most complex configuration option, especially if you haven't had some hard core
LDAP experience before.<br>
<br>
In <a href="/2008/03/using-ovd-filtered-directories-for-ldap.html">Using OVD Filtered Directories for LDAP
Authentication</a>, I talked about using ACLs to restrict access to certain parts of a directory: each Access Control
Rule has a filter setting, which is an LDAP filter that specifies which directory entries the rule applies to.<br>
<br>
However I also discovered that using complex (multiple term) Access Control Rule filters is a great way to kill the OVD
server process.
<blockquote>
  NB:it bombs with a <span class="code">java.lang.NullPointerException</span>, and it is necessary to go and manually
  remove the offending filter from the $OVD_HOME/conf/acls.os_xml file on the server before it will startup again.
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Say, for example, you wanted to grant access to entries for the ITGroup and HR departments. In <a href=
"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515">RFC 4515</a> LDAP search filter terms, we can write this simply as:<br>
<blockquote class="code">
  (|(departmentNumber=ITGroup)(departmentNumber=HR))
</blockquote><br>

<br>
But as mentioned, this will kill your OVD server (OVD 10.1.4.0.1 build 06.07.19).<br>
<br>
There is a simple work-around though, by reverting to simple set theory and write multiple rules. In other words,
granting <span class="code">(|(departmentNumber=ITGroup)(departmentNumber=HR))</span> is equivalent to two rules
applied in sequence:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Grant: <span class="code">(departmentNumber=ITGroup)</span>
  </li>
  <li>Grant: <span class="code">(departmentNumber=HR)</span>
  </li>
</ul><br>

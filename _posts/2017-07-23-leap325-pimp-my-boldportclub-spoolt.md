Building the latest Boldport Club project - "spoolt", a solder dispenser. It actually works and now has a place on my workbench.
It's also a nice reminder and inspiration to consider how PCBs can be used as a structural element in design.
Of course one essential feature it was missing was LEDs - so I've added those myself;-)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]
Here's a quick demo:

I remember first getting hooked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ludlum">Robert Ludlum</a> when
I was about 13. Desperate for something to relieve the boredom while sick for a few weeks, I borrowed <a href=
"https://amzn.to/3GdRGe4">
The Chancellor Manuscript</a> from my Dad. For many years,
devouring and dissecting the latest Ludlum was a unique pleasure we shared.<br>
<br>
I guess my reading interests wandered, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3T6VnoP">The Ambler Warning</a> is one of the first Ludlum books I've
read for some time. I was surprised he was still writing. A quick check unfortunately confirmed that the newer
books are ghost-written under the direction of Ludlum's estate, and apparently based on the wealth of notes and
partially completed works he left behind. Sadly, Robert Ludlum himself died in 2001.<br>
<br>
Putting these thoughts aside however, <strong>The Ambler Warning</strong> stands up as a very engaging read in
true Ludlum style. Harrison Ambler, former covert operative, escapes from a state psychiatric facility. Even as
he tries to make sense of his own memories, it seems everyone is out to kill him. Finding out why is the key to
his sanity, and also stopping the bad guys.<br>
<br>
Coincidentally, it proved to be an evocative counter-point to the last book I read, <a href=
"/2007/07/blink.html">blink</a>. Harrison Ambler is so successful in the field because he has the ability to
instantly and accurately <em>read</em> people .. <em>"the walking polygraph"</em>. At the outset, he has
uber-rational CIA auditor Clayton Caston on his tail .. <em>"..don't talk to me about feelings.."</em>.
Ironically, they find that only in teaming up can they win.<br>
<br>
So in a way, this is affirming one of the central themes in blink: <strong>sometimes you can't trust gut
reaction, and sometimes you can't trust rational analysis either. But if you consider both, then you have
considerably increased your chances of being correct</strong>.<br>
<br>
Still more coincidences in the cameo department. As the book reaches a climax, action centers on the World
Economic Forum meeting at Davos..<br>
<blockquote>
  <em>"A couple of yards away from him, an older, rangy American billionaire - someone whose 'enterprise
  software' was an industry standard across the globe..."</em> Hmmm, ring any bells? If you don't think Bill
  makes 'enterprise software', then I reckon it can only be one person ... but then again, I did just read
  <a href="/2007/07/softwar-intimate-portrait-of-larry.html">Softwar</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <em>"Another audience member - a woman Ambler vaguely recognized from pictures, a CEO of a tech company,
  blond and perfectly coiffed - looked distracted, as if rehersing talking points for an upcoming
  interview.."</em> Got to be Carly!<br>
</blockquote><br>
Favourite quote:<br>
<blockquote>
  <em>"There's a difference between risk and uncertainty .. Risk is quantifiable. Uncertaintly isn't. It's one
  thing to know there's a fifty-fifty chance of something going wrong. It's another not to know what the
  chances are at all."</em>

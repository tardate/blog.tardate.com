I've wanted a variable mains-powered power supply for a while, so when I found <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/EU-US-LM317-1-25V-12V-Continuously-Adjustable-Regulated-Voltage-Power-Supply-DIY-Kit/32463018423.html">this kit</a> for a reasonable price I decided to give it a go. Some things that attracted me:<br /><br /><ul><li>220V/110V mains-powered</li><li>continuously adjustable output voltage</li><li>isolated output</li><li>nice acrylic case</li><li>built-in LED voltmeter</li></ul><br />The kit and PCB comes with a few "valued-added features" unrelated to the power supply function (CD4069 square-wave generator, externally-triggered piezo buzzer, externally-triggered polarity tester), but I decided to leave those out of the build.<br /><br />I also enjoyed investigating and old-school transformer-based power supply. These are getting rare .. it's hard to even find a 220/12 transformer for less than the price of the kit these days, and then they are mostly used/refurbished.<br /><br />How does it perform? Nice! No smoke on power-up, but a few things to note and/or improve. And I'm sure it wouldn't pass a safety certification, so don't go building one like this for friends.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PowerSupply317Kit">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PowerSupply317Kit" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PowerSupply317Kit/assets/PowerSupply317Kit_build.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

Bernard Cornwell is a master and commander when it comes to bringing alive European history from the last
millennia. Where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O%27Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a> has the sea,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cornwell">Cornwell</a> has the land.<br>
<br>
I've read most of the Richard Sharpe novels, but I first encountered the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cornwell#The_Grail_Quest_novels">grail quest</a> series as audio books
from audible.<br>
<br>
I must say that in combination with narration by <a href=
"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Se%C3%A1n+Barrett&k=Se%C3%A1n+Barrett">Seán Barrett</a>, I was absolutely hooked from the out. Together, they bring 14th century Europe to life like I
have never heard before. Cornwell with his words that pump life into long dead stories, and Barret with his
voice that just seems to call down through the ages.<br>
<br>
If only my 2nd form history lessons were like this. But how can history teachers brought up in the 1950's,
using text books written by dainty scholars hope to convey a true sense of the times?<br>
<br>

It may look quaint in a tapestry, but battle with sword and bow is particularly brutal. But of course for the
men of the time it was just all part of life. As Cornwell tells the tale of Thomas of Hookton, the grim reality
of life leaps from the page with Barrett's voice.<br>

Seriously, the best way to "read" the grail quest series is to listen on <a href=
"https://www.audible.com">audible</a>. There are three volumes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZP8Khb" class="book-title">Harlequin: The Grail Quest, Book I</a>
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3HVm5P0" class="book-title">Vagabond: The Grail Quest, Book II</a>
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3GiasRz" class="book-title">Heretic: The Grail Quest, Book III</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
A great companion read is <a href="https://amzn.to/3FTKZhp">1215: The Year of Magna Carta</a>.
It is a fascinating - and less dramatic - study of England in the 13th century: the years of Prince John, the legend of Robin Hood and of course the
Magna Carta.<br>
<br>
It was only after reading this, and having been imbued in the era thanks to the Grail Quest audible recordings by Seán
Barrett, that I finally got a true sense of the complex relationship between France and England after the Norman
conquests of Britain.<br>
<br>
And then there is the Magna Carta. Probably more significant as a legend and ideal than an actual statement of rights.
In its time, it seems to have been seen by some as a scandalous concession to the masses. Even Pope Innocent III
condemned the charter as<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  ..not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust, thereby lessening unduly and impairing his [the
  king's] royal rights and dignity
</blockquote><br>

<span style="font-style:italic;">Yes, it's time for some house cleaning!</span><br /><br />One of my favourite little hacks is how to <a href="https://blog.tardate.com/2007/09/adding-recaptcha-to-oracle-sso.html">add reCAPTCHA to Oracle SSO</a>, which I wrote about last year. I've now finally got around to setting it up with its own <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ossorecaptcha/">sourceforge project</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ossorecaptcha/">OssoRecaptcha</a> is a demonstration of integrating the CAPTCHA service from <a href="http://recaptcha.org">recaptcha.org</a> with Oracle Single-Sign-On. It can be used in production OSSO deployments, and also as an example of integrating any 3rd party authentication system with OSSO.<br /><br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ossorecaptcha/"><img src="https://sflogo.sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=228549&amp;type=5" width="210" height="62" border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo" /></a>

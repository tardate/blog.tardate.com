The DHT11 sensor is a very cheap and common sensor that provides readings of relative humidity (20-80% ±5%)
and temperature (0-50°C ±2°C). For a first test, I'm using a simple DHT11 library from the arduino playground.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

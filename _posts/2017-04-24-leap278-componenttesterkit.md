Component testers are very handy things to have around.
They are also interesting bits of kit to design and build, as you get to play around in the fascinating niche of test equipment and techniques.
I've buit a range of test equipment, and will probably build much more, but I've always got time for another kit!
I was interseted in testing out this particular kit, as it is reprasentative of a whole class of simialr products
that all trace their history back to original open source work by the folks on [www.mikrocontroller.net](http://www.mikrocontroller.net)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

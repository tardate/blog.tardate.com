The Cuttle is a bare-bones Arduino-compatible kit from The Boldport Club.
But not just any clone .. this must be the best looking board I have!
I now have three of them for prototyping with style;-)
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

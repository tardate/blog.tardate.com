A couple of TEA5767 Low-power FM stereo radio chips landed in my lap. They arrived mounted on a small module board with all the essential supporting circuitry, so they should be ready to run without much external hardware.
This project is a simple test drive under Arduino control.
It simply skips through a selection of local FM stations and works amazingly well!
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project].

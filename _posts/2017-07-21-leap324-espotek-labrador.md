The [EspoTek Labrador](https://www.crowdsupply.com/espotek/labrador) is a crowd-funded
lab-on-a-board that includes an oscilloscope, waveform generator, power supply, logic analyzer, and multimeter.
I was drawn to the project specifically because it promised open hardware, and multi-platform open source software.
I'm really impressed by my first tests - no trouble getting the board up and running on MacOSX.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

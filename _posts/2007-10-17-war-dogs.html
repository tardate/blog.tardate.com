Picked up Michael Farmer's
<a href="https://amzn.to/3HYdg6R" class="book-title">War Dogs</a>
from the library the other day. Proved to be a great
airport/trip read.<br>
<br>
Its the third in a series of "alternate future-histories" set around the middle-east conflicts from Desert
Shield onwards.<br>
<br>

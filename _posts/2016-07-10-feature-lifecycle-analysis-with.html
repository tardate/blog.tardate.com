Can you trust your agile planning process to deliver the best result over time?<br>
<br>
In an ideal world with a well-balanced and high-performing team, theory says it should all be dandy. But what happens
when the real world sticks it's nose in and you need to deal with varying degrees of disfunction?<br>
<br>
Feature Lifecycle Analysis is a technique I've been experimenting with for a few years. The idea is to visualise how
well we are doing as a team at balancing our efforts between new feature development, refinement, maintenance and
ultimately feature deprecation.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to find out more, and run an analysis on your own projects, try out the <a href=
"https://fla.evendis.com/">Feature Lifecycle Analysis</a> site. It includes some analysis of two real software
development projects, and also a tool for analysing your own PivotalTracker projects.<br>

Mandrill is the transactional email service by the same folks who do MailChimp. I've <a href=
"http://tardate.blogspot.sg/2013/02/easy-mandrill-inbound-email-and-webhook.html">written about it</a> before, in
particular how to use the <a href="https://github.com/evendis/mandrill-rails">mandrill-rails</a> gem to simplify
inbound webhook processing.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://help.mandrill.com/entries/21738186-Introduction-to-Webhooks">Mandrill webhooks</a> are a neat, easy way
for your application to respond to various events, from recording when users open email, to handling inbound mail
delivery.<br>
<br>
That all works fine if your web application lives on the public internet i.e. Mandrill can reach it to post the
webhook. But that's not always possible: your development/test/staging environments for example; or perhaps production
servers that IT have told you must be "locked down to the max".<br>
<br>
Mandrill currently doesn't offer an official IP whitelist, so it's not possible to use firewall rules to just let
Mandrill servers in. Mandrill does provide webhook authentication (supported by the <a href=
"https://github.com/evendis/mandrill-rails">mandrill-rails</a> gem), but that solves a different problem: anyone can
reach your server, but you can distinguish the legitimate webhook requests.<br>
<br>
I thought I'd share a couple of techniques I've used to get Mandrill happily posting webhooks to my dev machine and
servers behind firewalls.<br>
<br>
<h3>
  Using HAProxy to reverse-proxy Mandrill Webhooks
</h3>If you have at least one internet-visible address, <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> is excellent for
setting up a reverse-proxy to forward inbound Mandrill Webhooks to the correct machine inside the firewall. I'm
currently using this for some staging servers so we can run real inbound mail scenarios.<br>
<br>
Here's a simple scenario:<br>
<ul>
  <li>gateway.mydomain.net - your publicly-visible server, with HAProxy installed and running OK
  </li>
  <li>internal/192.168.0.1 - a machine on an internal network that you want to receive webooks posted to
  192.168.0.1:8080/inbox
  </li>
</ul><br>
Say the gateway machine already hosts http://gateway.mydomain.net, but we want to be able to tell Mandrill to post it's
webhooks to http://gateway.mydomain.net/inbox_internal, and these (and only these) requests will be forwarded to
http://192.168.0.1:8080/inbox.<br>
<br>
Here are the important parts of the /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg used on the gateway machine:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
global<br>  #...<br> <br>defaults<br>  mode http                                # enable http mode which gives of layer 7 filtering<br>  #...<br><br># this is HAProxy listening on http://gateway.mydomain.net<br>frontend app *:80                          <br>  default_backend webapp                   # set the default server for all requests<br>  # next we define a rule that will send requests to the internal_mandrill backend instead if the path starts with /inbox_internal<br>  acl req_mandrill_inbox_path path_beg /inbox_internal <br>  use_backend internal_mandrill if req_mandrill_inbox_path <br><br># define a group of backend servers for the main web app<br>backend webapp                             <br>  server app1 127.0.0.1:8001             <br> <br># this is where we will send the Mandrill webhooks<br>backend internal_mandrill                  <br>  reqirep     ^([^\ ]*)\ /inbox_internal(.*) \1\ /inbox\2 <br>  server int1 192.168.0.1:8080  # add a server to this backend<br>
</pre>Obviously the path mapping is optional (but neat to demonstrate), and I've left out all the normal HAProxy
options like balancing, checks and SSL option forwarding that you might require in practice, but are not relevant to
the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
<strong>Job done!</strong> Our internal server remains hidden behind the firewall, but Mandrill can get through to it
by posting webhooks to http://gateway.mydomain.net/inbox_internal.<br>
<br>
<h3>
  Tunneling to dev machines with ngrok
</h3>For development, we usually don't want anything so permanent. There are quite a few services for tunneling to
localhost, mainly with developers in mind. Lately I've been using <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">ngrok</a> which
is living up to it's name - it rocks! Trival to setup and works like a dream. Say I'm developing a Rails app:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
# run app locally (port 3000)<br>rails s<br># run ngrok tunnel to port 3000<br>ngrok 3000
</pre><br>
Once started, ngrok will give you http and https addresses that will tunnel to port 3000 on your machine. You can use
these addresses in the Mandrill webhook and inbound domains configuration, and they'll work as long as you keep your
app and ngrok running.

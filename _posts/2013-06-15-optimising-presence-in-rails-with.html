It is a pretty common pattern to branch depending on whether a query returns any data - for example to render a quite
different view. In Rails we might do something like this:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
query = User.where(deleted_at: nil).and_maybe_some_other_scopes<br>if results = query.presence<br>  results.each {|row| ... }<br>else<br>  # do something else<br>end
</pre>When this code executes, we raise at least 2 database requests: one to check presence, and another to retrieve
the data. Running this at the Rails console, we can see the queries logged as they execute, for example:<br>
<pre name="code" class="sql:wraplines:nocontrols">
(0.9ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL<br> User Load (15.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL
</pre>This is not surprising since under the covers, <tt>presence</tt> (or <tt>present?</tt>) end up calling
<tt>count</tt> which must do the database query (unless you have already accessed/loaded the results set). And 0.9ms
doesn't seem too high a price to pay to determine if you should even try to load the data, does it?<br>
<br>
But when we are running on PostgreSQL in particular, we've learned to be leery of COUNT(*) due to it's well known
<a href="http://postgresql.1045698.n5.nabble.com/Slow-count-again-td3206177.html">performance problems</a>. In fact I
first started digging into this question when I started seeing expensive COUNT(*) queries show up in <a href=
"http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> slow transaction traces. How expensive COUNT(*) actually is depends on many factors
including the complexity of the query, availability of indexes, size of the table, and size of the results set.<br>
<br>
So can we improve things by avoiding the COUNT(*) query? Assuming we are going to use all the results anyway, and we
haven't injected any calculated columns in the query, we could simply <tt>to_a</tt> the query before testing presence
i.e.:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
query = User.where(deleted_at: nil).and_maybe_some_other_scopes<br>if results = query.to_a.presence<br>  results.each {|row| ... }<br>else<br>  # do something else<br>end
</pre><br>
I ran some benchmarks comparing the two approaches with different kinds of queries on a pretty well-tuned system and
here are some of the results:<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Query
    </th>
    <th>
      Using present?
    </th>
    <th>
      Using to_a
    </th>
    <th>
      Faster By
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      10k indexed queries returning 1 / 1716 rows
    </td>
    <td>
      17.511s
    </td>
    <td>
      10.938s
    </td>
    <td style="color: green; weight: bold">
      38%
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      4k complex un-indexed queries returning 12 / 1716 rows
    </td>
    <td>
      23.603s
    </td>
    <td>
      15.221s
    </td>
    <td style="color: green; weight: bold">
      36%
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      4k indexed queries returning 1 / 1763218 rows
    </td>
    <td>
      22.943s
    </td>
    <td>
      20.924s
    </td>
    <td style="color: green; weight: bold">
      9%
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      10 complex un-indexed queries returning 15 / 1763218 rows
    </td>
    <td>
      23.196s
    </td>
    <td>
      14.072s
    </td>
    <td style="color: green; weight: bold">
      40%
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
Clearly, depending on the type of query we can gain up to 40% performance improvement by restructuring our code a
little. While my aggregate results were fairly consistent over many runs, the performance of individual queries did
vary quite widely.<br>
<br>
I should note that the numbers were *not* consistent or proportional across development, staging, test and production
environments (mainly due to differences in data volumes, latent activity and hardware) - so you can't benchmark on
development and assume the same applies in production.<br>
<br>
<h3>
  Things get murky with ActiveRecord add-ons
</h3>So far we've talked about the standard ActiveRecord situation. But there are various gems we might also be using
to add features like pagination and search magic. <a href="https://github.com/ernie/meta_search">MetaSearch</a> is an
example: a pretty awesome gem for building complex and flexible search features. But (at least with version 1.1.3)
<tt>present?</tt> has a little surprise in store for you:<br>
<pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">
irb&gt; User.where(id: '0').class<br>=&gt; ActiveRecord::Relation<br>irb&gt; User.where(id: 0).present?<br>   (0.8ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 0<br>=&gt; false<br>irb&gt; User.search(id_eq: 0).class<br>=&gt; MetaSearch::Searches::User<br>irb&gt; User.search(id_eq: 0).present?<br>=&gt; true
</pre><br>
<h3>
  Any Guidelines?
</h3>So, always <tt>to_a</tt> my query results? Well, no, it's not that simple. Here are some things to consider:<br>
<ul>
  <li>First, don't assume that <tt>&lt;my_scoped_query&gt;.present?</tt> means what you think it might mean - test or
  play it safe
  </li>
  <li>If you are going to need all result rows anyway, consider calling <tt>to_a</tt> or similar before testing
  <tt>presence</tt>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid this kind of optimisation except at the point of use. One of the beauties of ActiveRecord::Relation is the
  chainability - something we'll kill as soon as we hydrate to a result set Array for example.
  </li>
  <li>While I got a nice 40% performance bonus in some cases with a minor code fiddle, mileage varies and much depends
  on the actual query. You probably want to benchmark in the actual environment that matters and not make any
  assumptions.
  </li>
</ul>

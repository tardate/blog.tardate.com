<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><a href="http://librivox.org/the-right-way-to-do-wrong-by-harry-houdini/">The Right Way To Do Wrong - An Expos√© of Successful Criminals</a> is a very old book, published in 1906. I was intrigued since it was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini">Harry Houdini</a>, and I hadn't realised he was also an author.<br /><br />Houdini's motive for writing the book is to warn off the righteous by educating them in all forms of devious frauds and scams, and to cause those less well intentioned to give pause before taking up a life of crime.<br /><br />Reading the book over 100 years after publication, I am amazed - but perhaps on reflection not surprised - that Houdini manages to describe in great detail <strong>just about every Internet-related scam in existence</strong> (allowing of course for a transposition of technology)!<br /><br />When he talks of <em>Begging Letter Swindles</em>, think <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/nigerian-letter-or-419-fraud">Nigerian Letter or "419" Fraud</a>. For <em>Tricks of Bunco Men</em>, see <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/advance-fee-schemes">Advance Fee Scheme</a>. The ease in which <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/identity-theft">Impersonation/Identity Fraud</a> was practiced in a pre-IT age... and just about every other gambit you can find on the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes">FBI Common Fraud Schemes</a> site, or in this great article on <a href="https://thebestvpn.com/online-scams-frauds-statistics/">Worst Online Scams and Internet Frauds + tips for avoiding them</a>.<br /><br />If you are into IT Security, I think you'd enjoy reading this and mulling over the relevance to your day-to-day work. It is salutary to realise there is nothing new in <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamsha125015.html">the Evil that Men do</a>, just new ways of doing it!<br /><br /><em>I listened to <strong>The Right Way To Do Wrong</strong> in audio from <a href="http://librivox.org/the-right-way-to-do-wrong-by-harry-houdini/">LibriVox</a>. It is also available in print from <a href="http://amzn.to/2q6BWBg">Amazon</a>.</em> </td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=itsaprli-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=1602060789&asins=1602060789&linkId=b0de23b75900aa0531da8023982b5a97&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table>

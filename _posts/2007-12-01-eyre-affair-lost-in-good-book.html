<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">My sister introduced me to Thursday Next, the SpecOps literary crimes specialist (who even has her own <a href="http://www.thursdaynext.com/index2.html">website</a>). <strong>The Eyre Affair</strong> by <a href="http://www.jasperfforde.com/">Jasper Fforde</a> was a gift that I am sorry to say sat around for too long before being picked up. But once I did, I was hooked. Soon moved on to the second in the series - <strong>Lost in a Good Book</strong>. I only hope I got to them quick enough ... who knows how they could have changed in the meantime? <em>NB: You will understand that once you have met Thursday Next</em>.<br /><br />See, Thursday is trying to stop the literary puritans, villains and other particularly unsavoury geezers from sneaking inside books and changing the plot to suit themselves. Or characters from one novel vacationing in another. Of even kidnapping of the lead roles.<br /><br />OK, so maybe I can't explain it very well. Just take it from me that it is a mind-bending laugh. I can't help thinking Jasper Fforde has created a whole new literary genre .... but I am wondering what Thursday would think of that? Is that allowed?<br /><br />This excerpt from when Thursday visits a novel may (or not) help you understand ...<br /><blockquote class="quote"> <br />"Hello!" she said in a friendly voice. "I haven't seen you around here before [...]"<br />"Don't we have to be careful as to what we say?" [Thursday Next] managed to utter, looking around nervously.<br />"Goodness me <em>no</em>!" exclaimed Marianne with a delightful giggle. "The chapter is over and, besides, this book is written in the <em>third person</em>. We are free to do what we please until tomorrow morning when we depart for Devon. The next two chapters are heavy with exposition - I hardly have anything to do, and I say even less! You look confused, poor thing! Have you been in a book before?"<br />"I went into <em>Jane Eyre</em> once."<br />Marianne frowned overdrammatically.<br />"Poor, dear, sweet Jane! I would so hate to be a first-person character! Always on your guard, always having people reading your thoughts! Here we <em>do</em> what we are told but <em>think</em> what we wish. It is a much happier circumstance, believe me!" </blockquote><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142001805?tag=itsaprli-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0142001805&adid=0X86AZ4PCTFP5FC1S6NE&"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HKWNCZ7XL._AA240_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> If you need something fresh and fun to read, bet on Thursday. Can't say I like the new covers though ... prefer the older comic-style. <br /><strong>See? Turn your back, and someone is off changing the books, which just isn't right.</strong><br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0142001805&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0142004030&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table>

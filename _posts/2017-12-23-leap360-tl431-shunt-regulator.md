The TL431 Precision Programmable Reference is a cheap and easily adjustable shunt regulator.
The standard grade offers a reasonable 2% reference voltage tolerance.

In this mini-circuit I am testing the common application as a shunt regulator/reference voltage e.g. for use in power supplies.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

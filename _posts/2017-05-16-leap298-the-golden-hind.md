A nice diversion .. a simple kit of the **Golden Hind** (Model 9209) ended up in my shopping cart on an impulse.
I've been curious about the recent popularity of these *mini 3D metal models*.
I am guessing the availability and affordability of precision laser cutting equipment might have something to do with it.
The **Metal Earth** brand is often seen in toy retailers (it even [has its own sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalearth/)!),
but the model designs all see to be common from a few Chinese manufacturers. The model I have here comes from
[Shantou Mini Qute Trading Co. Ltd.](https://mqfun.en.alibaba.com/)

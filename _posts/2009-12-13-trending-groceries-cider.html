You know when your local supermarkets and shops never stock one of your favourite things? <br /><br />But you search the shelves on every visit anyway (just in case).<br /><br />And when you do find it (even though you weren't really expecting to) you just have to buy it.<br /><br />And you hope that somewhere back in the warehouse an alarm went off, and the clerks are leaping into action..<br /><blockquote class="quote">Smithers, we're spiking on sales of X. Hurry man, there's no time to waste: Reorder! Replenish! We must never go out of stock again.</blockquote>Rationally, your "consumer activism" is hardly a blip on the radar/grain of sand in the Sahara. But maybe it's more like tweeting to your grocery manager, and hoping you'll kick off a "trending groceries" list to get their attention.<br /><br />Well, I thought I'd start a list of my own "trending groceries". Today: cider..<br /><hr/><h2>#1: #cider</h2>So rare to find in Singapore. For the past few years I've been unconsciously checking on every visit to my local <a href="http://www.fairprice.com.sg/">NTUC Fairprice</a>.<br /><br />And then one fortuitous day I found a <a href="http://www.pipsqueakcider.com.au/">Pipsqueak</a> 4-pack sitting on the shelf like a poor orphan. I had to adopt it of course, and have been back every week to save more of of it's brothers and sisters.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SyREQ5L0JeI/AAAAAAAABBg/IxBr-7YjDu8/s1600-h/pipsqueak.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SyREQ5L0JeI/AAAAAAAABBg/IxBr-7YjDu8/s400/pipsqueak.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414527709025150434" /></a>

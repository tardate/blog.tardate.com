I have been reading up on the PT2399 echo audio processor, and a good way of seeing one action
is to pick up one of the many delay effects pedals.

I [kit I found](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/NEW-DIY-electric-Guitar-Delay-analog-Effect-Pedals-Electric-pedal-guitarra-delay-Suite-Delay-1-pedals/32589004909.html)
is nicely put together with a pre-drilled and decorated 1590B enclosure, and some very nice knobs and smooth pots.
The build was a breeze, and results are actually pretty decent. As always, [all notes and schematics are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project].

Here's a quick hit to demo the effect, with a clean guitar signal and all the effect settings on "11" (mix, repeat, delay)...

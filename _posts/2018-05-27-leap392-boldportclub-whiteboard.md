The BoldportClub project #22 **whiteboard** is a neat little "breadboard enhancer", featuring variable and coin-cell power supplies and prototyping areas.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Here's a simple demonstration using the 4 LEDs on the shroud as outputs for a 4-stage CD4060 ripple counter:

Also included is a sheet of **StickerCAD** icons.
I used them on my laptop case - including a rebus if you look carefully;-)

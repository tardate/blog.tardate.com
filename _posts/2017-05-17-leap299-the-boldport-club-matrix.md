The Matrix is an I²C-controlled 24x5 LED matrix display, powered by an AMS AS1130 LED driver.
It's made of 0.2mm thick circuit board so it can slightly bend. A few can be chained together for a larger display.
With 120 0805 LEDs and an SSOP-28 AS1130, this kit is another great excuse to fire up the hot-air and
get a [stencil from OSHStencils](https://www.oshstencils.com/#projects/b0f4128d644cff5424abcb2829a05980179f08fc).
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

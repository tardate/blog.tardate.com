I'm humming and hahing over some form designs at the moment. These days you have so many options, especially
when you are getting smart with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">ajax</a> and
<a href="http://script.aculo.us/">scriptaculous</a> tricks.<br>
<br>
Having options is always a double-edged sword. Yes, they allow you to do amazing things. But they provide a
great recipe for procrastination.<br>
<br>
.. just the situation where some thoughtful, concise guidance on leading practices from someone who knows their
stuff can be a goldmine.<br>
<br>
Thankfully I stumbled upon this great presentation on web form design by Luke Wroblewski. It's a classic, and
now I see he has a book out on the topic -

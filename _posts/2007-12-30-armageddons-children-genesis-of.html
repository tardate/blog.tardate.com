Check any bookshop's fantasy section and you are sure to find a number of title by Terry Brooks (along with the
<em>other</em> Terry). I've never read him before though, and picked up
<a href="https://amzn.to/3T4xLkR" class="book-title">Armageddon's Children - Genesis of Shannara Book 1</a>
out of interest back in November.<br>

I'd stress <em>begins</em>. I found myself drawn in as the story unfolds and characters are introduced from
three or four distinct story lines, and awed by the imagination that Terry Brooks has pured into the backstory.
A crescendo of plots and conflicts builds...<br>
<br>
.. and then you get to the end of the book.<br>
<br>
No doubt an amazing epic in the telling, if you are committed to reading the whole series. Personally, I
decided to cut my losses (at least for the time being). Telling a story in multiple parts is fine by me, but
with each "part" coming in at 400 hundred odd pages good story-telling dictates making each part a satisfying
whole in its own right. I am sure there are many fans who will disagree and gleefully devour the whole series.
To each his/her own...

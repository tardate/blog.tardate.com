<br></iframe> Ruby developers are a pretty spoilt bunch these days. The community has overall done a great job of
rolling many of the advances in modern development practice into the tools and conventions we unconsciously put to work
every day.<br>

</div><b>Now I wonder what life is like in the Python community?</b> Like many Rubyists, I've played around with Python
and Jython on and off. But nothing serious. And although you could get into a pedantic syntax war, I suspect for the
most part the Python and Ruby communities don't overlap simply because once you dive into one camp, the only real
reason you would switch to the other is because of some external driver (like a client's development standards).<br>
<br>
It was a casual discussion about testing that re-ignited my interest in taking a peek over the fence. I picked up a
copy of Greg L. Turnquist's <strong>Python Testing Cookbook</strong> and enjoyed playing around with a couple of the
Python testing tools. It's an excellent book for ramping up your testing skills with Python - eminently clear and
practical.<br>
<br>
I was pretty sure that if any language community came close to matching Ruby's approach to development it would be
Python. But is that true?<br>
<br>
Most comparisons of Ruby and Python (like <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby">here</a>, <a href=
"http://danvk.org/josephus.html">here</a> and <a href="http://dev.pocoo.org/~mitsuhiko/pythonruby.html">here</a>) focus
on language syntax and features. Conclusion?<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  same but different!<br>
</blockquote>What I find more interesting is a comparison of the fundamental productivity patterns used in each
community, assuming your goal is to produce high-quality code that can be reliably distributed or deployed, and likely
makes liberal use of other - probably open source - code components.<br>
<br>
So here is a rundown for some of the common patterns I could not do without when developing in Ruby, and what appear to
be the leading Python equivalents - according to my research as of Oct-2012, but I welcome corrections and further
information from any Python experts out there!<br>
<br>
<h3>
  Environment Partitioning
</h3>We don't like dependencies from other projects leaking over to contaminate and confound what we are trying to work
on. While you could run up a separate VM for each project, it is much better if you have tools that can keep installed
libraries and even the language distributions separate for each project.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: <a href="https://rvm.io/">rvm</a> is the leading tool for creating isolated ruby
and gemset environments. A less intrusive alternative is <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>
(compared <a href="http://jonathan-jackson.net/rvm-and-rbenv">here</a>).<br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> creates
isolated Python environments. Ref: <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2812471/is-there-a-python-equivalent-of-rubys-rvm">SO</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>
  Dependency Management
</h3>It is likely our project will make use of other packages. We want automatic dependency management so that we can
easy deploy predictable compositions of code packages.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: <a href="http://gembundler.com/">bundler</a><br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pip</a> with a requirements.txt file.
Ref: <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8726207/what-is-softwares-in-python-which-are-alternative-to-rubys-bundler-perls-car">
SO</a><br>
<br>
<h3>
  Reusable Code Packaging
</h3>For anything more than trivial scripts, we probably want to package our project so that it can be reliably
distributed or deployed.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: we use <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/">gems</a>.
Easily built by hand, or bootstrapped with a tool like <a href="http://gembundler.com/rubygems.html">bundler</a> or
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/jeweler">jeweler</a><br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: use <a href=
"http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a> (enhancements to the Python distutils) to build and
distribute <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs">eggs</a>. Ref: <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2026395/how-to-create-python-egg-file">SO</a><br>
<br>
<h3>
  Reusable Code Distribution
</h3>Both Ruby and Python are very open-source oriented programming communities. Not only do we consume a great deal,
but it's likely we'll often want to make our own contributions easily available to others.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> for distribution, with source code
most often found on <a href="https://github.com">github</a>.<br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pip</a>. And source code also seems to
be showing up more on <a href="https://github.com">github</a> than historical use of svn repositories. Ref: <a href=
"http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-Python-equivalent-for-Rubys-Gem-or-Perls-CPAN-system">quora</a><br>
<br>
<h3>
  Project Build Tool
</h3>We'd prefer a common approach to running project build, doc, install and test tasks rather than rolling our own
for each project.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a>.<br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: this one I'm not so sure of. It seems most projects simply provide a custom
setup script using <a href="http://docs.python.org/distutils/index.html">distutils</a>, but there are a <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407837/is-there-an-rake-equivalent-in-python">variety of projects</a> that support
more complex build requirements. Ref: <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1407837/is-there-an-rake-equivalent-in-python">SO</a><br>
<br>
<h3>
  Automated Testing
</h3>It's 2012 already, we know that automated testing is a cornerstone of quality software. Especially so for code
that is going to be widely shared and reused. Whether you do TDD, BDD or simply unit test, we all have a good test
framework or two on our toolbelt.<br>
<br>
<b style="color:red">The Ruby Way</b>: <a href="http://test-unit.rubyforge.org/">Test::Unit</a>, <a href=
"https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> amongst others. It is extremely
rare to find a project these days that doesn't have tests of some flavour.<br>
<b style="color:green">The Python Way</b>: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
(sometimes called PyUnit) and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> are common frameworks
for unit testing and TDD. <a href="https://github.com/nose-devs/nose">nose</a> is a test runner, especially good for
non-trivial projects. <a href="https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce">Lettuce</a> is the rough Python equivalent of
Cucumber. Like Ruby, there are many other projects to assist testing such as mocking tools like <a href=
"https://github.com/edgeware/mockito-python">Mockito</a>.<br>
<b style="color:blue">Bonus</b>: open source projects have been rapidly adopting <a href=
"https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> for automated continuous integration on the back of a <a href=
"https://github.com">github</a> commit. And it works for <b style="color:red">Ruby</b> and <b style=
"color:green">Python</b>.<br>

        After enjoying <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/quarter-share/">Quarter Share</a> so much, I quickly
        listened to the sequels <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/half-share/">Half Share</a> and <a href=
        "http://podiobooks.com/title/full-share/">Full Share</a>. They continue Ishmael Wang's career aboard the Space
        Clipper <span style="font-style:italic;">Lois McKendrick</span> in rollicking fashion. Honest to goodness
        ripping yarns!<br>
        <br>
        I was sad to complete the trilogy, buoyed only by the hope that the author, <span style=
        "font-weight:bold;">Nathan Lowell</span>, would continue the series.<br>
        <br>
        Well, this post is coming quite a while after I listened to the three stories, and it seems Mr Lowell has been
        busy. I was reminded to checkout the latest when I saw <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/">Podiobooks
        report</a> that Nathan Lowell has taken a break from his own stories to narrate <a href=
        "http://www.podiobooks.com/blog/2008/03/14/time-crime/">Time Crime</a> by H. Beam Piper (iTunes
        downloading...)<br>
        <br>
        So of course I checked out Nathan's site - <a href="http://durandus.org/golden/">The Traderâ€™s Diary</a> - to
        discover Nathan has already completed another in the Golden Age series: <a href=
        "http://podiobooks.com/title/south-coast/">South Coast</a>. And its already #3 in the Podiobooks <a href=
        "http://podiobooks.com/charts.php">Top Overall Ratings</a> chart.<br>
        <br>
        ...my iTunes is running hot now!

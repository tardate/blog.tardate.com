I remember lusting after an Ibanez Tube Screamer back in the day - they really were the stuff of legend.
The most famous is perhaps the TS-808. After researching the original circuit and examining how it works in detail.
I decided to build one with only a few modifications to the original circuit.
I'm calling it The Goblin, owing to the custom stippled-green paint job I gave the 1590B enclosure.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

I'm really impressed with the sound it produces. Here's a quick soundcheck and smoke test:

This is a single-channel 10W guitar practice amplifier circuit based on the TDA2050 and was designed for the
Fundamentals of Audio and Music Engineering: Part 1 Musical Sound & Electronics course offered by University of Rochester on Coursera.
The amplifier itself is designed to teach simple tone and distortion circuitry.
I've built and tested the main board, now just need to make a cabinet on a spare weekend.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

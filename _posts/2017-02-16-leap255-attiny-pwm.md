PWM with ATtiny is not simply a subset of how things work on the ATmega328.
It offers some different capabilities.
This is my summary of hardware PWM control with a range of examples of controlling duty cycle and frequency with the ATtiny85.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

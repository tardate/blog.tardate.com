I've been researching attractions along the [Atsumi Peninsula “Donburi (Rice bowl) Kaido Road”](https://www.taharakankou.gr.jp/eng/feature/donburi.php)
such as [民宿お食事処 田原屋 Minshuku Restaurant Tawaraya](https://www.taharakankou.gr.jp/spot/000299.html) - [see their site](https://iragosunaba.amebaownd.com/).

It's near Irago Seapark - who managed to capture the attention of the satellites at just the right time!

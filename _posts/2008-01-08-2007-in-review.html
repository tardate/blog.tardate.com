<a href="http://bexhuff.com/2008/01/this-year-in-blog">Picking up the idea</a> to present "my blog-year in review", <strong>by taking just the first complete sentence each month's post</strong> <em>(remembering not to make this the first post for Jan;-)</em><br /><br /><table border=0><tr><td><strong>January </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/01/axis-revisited-on-oc4j-axis-2.html">Apache Axis2 is the core engine for Web services.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>February </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/02/safe-occi-createstatelessconnectionpool.html">I've been working a bit with Oracle's OCCI (the C++ API for Oracle Database), and stateless connection pools in particular.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>March </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/03/whos-bound-to-that-port.html">Recently wanted to track down the details of the process that had a specific port open.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>April </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/04/find-and-tail-oracle-alert-log.html">"Where's the alert log?" .. usually the first thing you want to know when looking at a new database.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>May </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/05/getting-environment-variables-on-oracle.html">Say you have a connection to a remote Oracle Database server and want to get the ORACLE_HOME setting.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>June </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/06/mq-and-occi-demo.html">A little while ago I got to dust off my C++ skills for a project that was to use Oracle Database (via OCCI) and also Websphere MQ</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>July </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/07/log-buffer-54-carnival-of-vanities-for.html">This week its my pleasure to host Log Buffer #54, the Carnival of the Vanities for DBAs.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>August </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/08/innovation-on-show-at-openworld.html">I've just spent the past few days at Oracle OpenWorld Asia Pacific in Shanghai.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>September </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/09/adding-recaptcha-to-oracle-sso.html">I've blogged previously about playing with the reCAPTCHA service in Perl.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>October </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/10/why-sox-wont-keep-your-feet-dry.html">I had the privilege of listening to Kevin Walsh's "30/30" presentation last week.</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>November </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/11/moving-on-to-new-laptop-art.html">Well, today is my first as a member of the Oracle Alumni</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>December </strong></td><td><a href="/2007/12/facebooks-gonna-tank.html">Laurent Schneider just asked what LinkedIn is good for?.</a><br /></td></tr></table><br />Hmm, very geek. What's not listed is the post that generated the swiftest, strongest reaction: <a href="/2007/10/ballmer-peak-and-programmers-paradox.html">Ballmer Peak and the Programmers' Paradox</a>, which probably goes to show that frat humour is the surest way to internet fame;-)<br /><br />During the year I also started blogging quick reviews of all the books I read over at <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/">PrataLife</a>. So as a variation on the meme, here's my <strong>Book-Year In Review</strong>:<br /><br /><table border=0><tr><td><br /><strong>July</strong></td><td> <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/07/extraordinary-adventures-of-arsne-lupin.html">The Extraordinary Adventures of Ars√®ne Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar</a> (audiobook)<br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>August </strong></td><td><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/08/ambler-warning.html">The Ambler Warning</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>September </strong></td><td><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/09/different-point-of-view.html">A Different Point of View</a> (audiobook)<br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>October </strong></td><td><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/10/warden.html">The Warden</a> (audiobook)<br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>November </strong></td><td><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/11/code-generation-in-action.html">Code Generation In Action</a> <br /></td></tr><tr><td><strong>December </strong></td><td><a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2007/12/quarter-share.html">Quarter Share</a> (audiobook)<br /></td></tr></table><br />The number of audiobooks is a bit misleading, as I'm sure I actually read at least as many on paper (although Neal Stephenson is slowing me down a bit at the moment!). And ye gads, only one tech book! But this is to be expected: with fiction its easy to read and do a quick blog entry, whereas technical non-fiction is generally not suited to blogging an instantaneous reaction. They'll tend to stay on my desk/shelf for a <em>probationary period</em>;-)

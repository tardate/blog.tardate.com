Bombshell announcement on 29-Oct: drop.io have .. <a href=
"http://blog.drop.io/2010/10/29/an-important-update-on-the-future-of-drop-io/">struck a deal with Facebook.</a><br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  What this means is that Facebook has bought most of drop.io’s technology and assets, and Sam Lessin is moving to
  Facebook.
</blockquote><br>
<a href="http://drop.io">drop.io</a> was widely acclaimed as the simple file sharing mechanisms we all needed. It
resolutely solved the problem that everyone with a computer and a network connection has known at one time or another:
how to share files too cumbersome for email, without resorting to techno-geekery like ftp and such. And it worked.
Beautifully.<br>
<br>
But it doesn't work anymore.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Goodbye drop.io!</span> You were an amazing service. One of the best and brightest of
the Class of Web 2.0. You made things simple. You solved a real, pressing problem.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that's not what I'll remember you for now.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style:italic;">Instead, it will be for brewing a <span style="font-weight:bold;">thunderstorm of
concern over the very dependability of cloud services</span>, as <a href=
"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372243,00.asp">John C. Dvorak</a> went to town on in his column.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style:italic;">And for teaching us that it's true - <span style="font-weight:bold;">startup founders
really don't give a toss for their customers</span> if they can get a sweet deal and a plum job with one of the
heavyweights instead.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style:italic;">And for once again <span style="font-weight:bold;">propelling Facebook into the
privacy-conspiracy-theory limelight</span>. Sure, "no data will be transferred to Facebook", but they put you out of
business and bought "most of [your] technology and assets", right? So will we be surprised when Facebook takes aim to
lure it's unsuspecting users into sharing pretty much anything and everything - private, commercially confidential, and
otherwise - using Facebook?</span><br>
<br>
Well, I guess drop.io does really deserve our thanks for that last point, if anyone cares to notice.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/"><img style=

"https://www.dropbox.com/static/images/dropbox_logo_home.png" border="0" alt=""></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">The
very best news—for anyone who can't imagine life without drop.io—is that there is another exceptional product out there
called <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> that can handle most team sharing needs in addition to looking
after your personal documents.</span><br>
<br>
That's not a paid advertisement or anything. I simply use Dropbox everyday and just love it. I wouldn't be exaggerating
to say it's probably improved the way I work more than anything even the folks in Redmond or Cupertino have shipped in
recent memory.<br>

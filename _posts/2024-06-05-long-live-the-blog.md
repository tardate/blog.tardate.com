Over the past week I've subscribed to THREE NEW BLOGS in [the old reader](https://theoldreader.com/):

* Chris Meddings' [the Model Philosopher](https://modelphilosopher.com/)
* an amazing Shadow Box showcase [シャドーボックス・ラ・マーニ](https://shadow-box-ramagni.com/blog/)
* and [Build by Jake McKee](https://build.jakemckee.com/)

AND here's my first post in 4 years.

**Are blogs back!?!?!?!?!?!?**

I think so
and apparently I'm [not the only one](https://www.louisestigell.com/blog/the-blog-is-dead-long-live-the-blog). For two reasons:

* we're jaded by the entrenched social networks (especially when captured by raving loony fascist billionaires)
* and AI is rapidly devaluing the value of stumbled-upon content

For some like me, and admittedly perhaps not for the majority, this means I find myself skewing back to personally curated information and hand-crafted experiences.

Blogs are good at that.

For over a decade, Twitter was my main, and most preferred social network.
It was largely responsible for me skewing away from blogs.
I gave it up a few years ago when Musk took over, had a half-hearted attempt at moving to [mastodon](https://ruby.social/@tardate), but it never really fired in the same way.

I've since found a pretty nice home over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/little.electronic.art.projects/) - especially for my model builds and craft - but it is not a place for discussions.
And by virtue of my Instagram account I do dabble a bit in Facebook, but I try to avoid it (despite the insistence of some of the communities I circulate in to do all their business on Facebook ...harrumph).

Anyway for now, raise your glass and let's toast to the ongoing success of one of the most viral, subversive, and underground content movements the world has seen since the days of flagrant pamphleteering ... THE BLOG.

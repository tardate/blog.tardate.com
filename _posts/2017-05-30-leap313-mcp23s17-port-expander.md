The Microchip MCP23S17 is a 16-bit port expender
that can be controlled for example from an Arduino over SPI (MCP23017 is the IÂ²C variant).
It supports digital input and output on all pins, and interrupts can be configured if required.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

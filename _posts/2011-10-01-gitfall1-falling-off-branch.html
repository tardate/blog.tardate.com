Ever had a merge fail with a <b>fatal: git write-tree failed to write a tree</b> message out of the blue?<br>
<br>
It sounds terrifying, but when I got the root cause is quite mundane: file name conflicts in the merging commits that
git is not smart enough to figure out without help. And when you fixup your merge, you are left with a commit that's
lost one of its parents ("falling off a branch").<br>
<br>
If you do much file reorganisation in a project with branches, it turns out this can be quite common (had it a few
times on a recent project).<br>
<br>

  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6CecF1SzUIs/Toay9cKZndI/AAAAAAAAB7I/GngydK-K-dk/s1600/gitfall01.png" style=
  "clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="188" width="320" src=
  "/assets/2011-10-01-gitfall1-falling-off-branch/gitfall01.png"></a>
</div>In an attempt to understand exactly what was going on, I put together the steps needed to reproduce and recover
from the error. I've tidied these up and made it a full "tutorial/demo" script. You can find it in a repo called
<a href="https://github.com/tardate/gitfalls">gitfalls</a> - in the expectation that there are many more git
curiosities and idiosynchrasies worth a similar treatment. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
The script not only shows how to create the error, but two ways of resolving it and the "lost parent branch" issue:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Merge again after fixing the first failed commit. Duh!
  </li>
  <li>Going a bit deeper and using git commit-tree to manufacture a new merge commit with the correct parentage
  </li>
</ol><br>
Lessons learned form all of this? Perhaps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Avoid reorganising folder structures using folder names that once were used by files (or vice versa)
  </li>
  <li>If you must do such a reorganisation, immediately merge or cherry-pick to other active branches if you can. This
  avoids laying a trap for a co-worker to hit later on.
  </li>
</ol><br>
Hope you enjoy the script, and if you have any others to contribute please be my guest!<br>

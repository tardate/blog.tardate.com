[Wilf's Bird](http://solarbotics.net/library/circuits/misc_sound_wilfbird.html) is a pretty famous "bird chirp" sound effect by Wilf Rigter.
I last saw it used in Kelly Heaton's wonderful [bird sculpture](https://hackaday.io/project/163201-electronic-sculpture),
a Hackaday Circuit Sculpture contest winner.

The CANary is my little experiment with the sound effect.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

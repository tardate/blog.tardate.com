Somewhere in my travels (Five Below?) I picked up a cheap SpiderBot robot kit mainly to see how they drive the legs.
OK, interesting for about 15 minutes then I guess I started channeling Sid
and decided to hook it up with the BoldPort PissOff.

So now I have an angry sentry dog that scuttles about like a spider.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

The motor in the SpiderBot is really dirty and I had real trouble controlling it without interference, even with extreme isolation.
But perhaps imperfect crazy action is better after all..

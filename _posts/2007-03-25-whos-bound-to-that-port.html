Recently wanted to track down the details of the process that had a specific port open. I checked out the O'Reilly
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxsvrhack/">Linux Server Hacks</a> book, and hack #56 was pretty much what I
wanted. I scriptified it somewhat as follows. Note that this only looks at tcp:<br>
<blockquote class="code">
  #!/bin/bash<br>
  port=$1<br>
  procinfo=$(netstat --numeric-ports -nlp 2&gt; /dev/null | grep ^tcp | grep -w ${port} | tail -n 1 | awk '{print
  $7}')<br>
  <br>
  case "${procinfo}" in<br>
  "")<br>
  echo "No process listening on port ${port}"<br>
  ;;<br>
  "-")<br>
  echo "Process is running on ${port}, but current user does not have rights to see process information."<br>
  ;;<br>
  *)<br>
  echo "${procinfo} is running on port ${port}"<br>
  ps -uwep ${procinfo%/*}<br>
  ;;<br>
  esac<br>
</blockquote><br>
As you can see, this works by getting a little bit of process info from netstat, then using ps to get the full details.

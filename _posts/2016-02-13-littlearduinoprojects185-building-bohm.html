What has this to do with electronics? Well, nothing (yet), but there's ample scope later;-)<br>
<br>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine">Stirling engine</a> is a closed-cycle regenerative heat
engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid. They are named after Robert Stirling who invented the first practical
example in 1816.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.en.boehm-stirling.com/about-us.html">Böhm</a> is a small(?) specialist manufacturer from Germany
that's taken up a side-line in producing Stirling engine kits. When I first discovered them, I couldn't resist. So
here's my build of the <a href="http://www.en.boehm-stirling.com/hb13.html">Small Bonsai (HB-13)</a>.<br>
<br>
As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Kinetics/StirlingEngineHB13">all my
notes and schematics are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>.<br>

I dug out a 1.44 inch 128*128 SPI Color TFT LCD Module from my parts drawer as a possible display for a project I'm working on.
First .. put it to the test and try a couple of Arduino libraries.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

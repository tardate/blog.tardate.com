I covered programming an ATtiny with the Arduino ISP in the
[ATtinyWithArduinoISP](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/playground/ATtinyWithArduinoISP) project.
Since I've been programming a few more ATtiny processors, and simplify the processing of programming an ATtiny with ArduinoISP, I wired up a strip of protoboard to serve as a custom programming shield.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

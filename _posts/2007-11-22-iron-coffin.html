.. I really enjoyed this book by <a href="http://www.johnmannock.com">John Mannock</a>. It adds to my collection
of submarine books and movies.<br>
<br>
But <a href="https://amzn.to/3TFfvi1" class="book-title">Iron Coffin</a>
brings an interesting twist to the Das Boot-genre of WWII Kriegsmarine lore. The story
commences with the discovery of a U-boat wreck in a Louisiana river delta and a chance encounter in a local bar
with an old timer who can tell the story for the first and perhaps last time. How the disabled submarine sought
refuge in the bayous and sought help from the Cajun river dwellers. And the surprising twist that explains why
one of the sailors is left behind.<br>
<br>
Gritty, authentic detail and the unconventional story line make this a great read.

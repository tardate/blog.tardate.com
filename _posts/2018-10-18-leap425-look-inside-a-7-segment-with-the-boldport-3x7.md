A lovely PCB and classic Boldport instructions(!):

> This project is a challenge to construct.

The Boldport 3x7 is essentially a 3-digit common-cathode 7-segment display, rendered with discrete components.

Since it's a chance to look inside the workings of a 7-segment display unit, I decided to modify my build
to flip the lid and expose the internal wiring for inspection. Now it's built, more projects to follow!

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

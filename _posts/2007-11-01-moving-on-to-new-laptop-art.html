Well, today is my first as a member of the Oracle Alumni. It was sad to leave all of the great people and friends I've made over the years at Oracle, but greener pastures beckoned etc etc.<br /><br />I don't expect the change will affect the blog much (bar editing the disclaimer), since it has never really been so specifically about what I do at work.<br /><br />What it has changed is my choice of laptop art! Switching machines is traumatic at the best of times no matter how carefully you have backed up. For the time being I've switched to an old Compaq Presario we had at home called "Sunshine". It may no longer be the fastest chip in the mill, but it has a custom paint job to care for me through this transition;-)<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RynKZd0fZ9I/AAAAAAAAAMU/38dBXVS8vTA/s1600-h/DSCN2498.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RynKZd0fZ9I/AAAAAAAAAMU/38dBXVS8vTA/s400/DSCN2498.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127852189588350930" /></a><br /><br />I've always wanted to <strong>pimp my PC</strong>! It's more common these days to find designer cases and stick-ons, but not full custom jobs. This is acrylic with a hardy varnish finish. Unlike a spray job, it creates a nice texture that actually feels great under your wrists.<br /><br />It's a long story why I painted a <em>Care Bear</em>, but I daresay it makes it the cutest Compaq ever. I can almost half imagine myself firing up on wireless at Starbucks;-) Boy am I glad it isn't Hello Kitty!

This AT89S52-based "shake stick" kit pops up all over the place for a few dollars. I built it and hey, it works great! <br /><br />But it's not packaged to be easily re-programmed for other messages or graphics. So started my sleuthing.. which turned into a fascinating story.<br /><br />It seems the kit was originally designed and built as a uni project by Zheng Zhong Xing 兴向荣 (aka zhengzhongxing39) studying Control Technology and Instruments/Principles and Applications at a Chinese University. Reportedly "... soldering was troublesome, with lots of changes and no solid basic skills, so burned out the first board" ;-) But it seems persistence paid off, and ended up commercialising the kit and starting electronics business and taobao store where you can find this kit and many others.<br /><br />As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/PovShakeStickKit">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a>, including my annotation of the source code and schematic for the shake stick.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/PovShakeStickKit" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PovShakeStickKit/assets/PovShakeStickKit_demo.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/PovShakeStickKit" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/blob/master/Electronics101/PovShakeStickKit/assets/PovShakeStickKit_build.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 90%"/></a></div>

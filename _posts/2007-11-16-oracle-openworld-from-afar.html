The <a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2007/10/12/bloggers-at-openworld/trackback/">Bloggers at Openworld</a>
announcement promised to make this years conference a very different experience than ever before. Especially for people
like myself who weren't able to attend. I'd like to add my big vote of thanks to the OTN, AppsLab and Oracle bloggers,
whose combined efforts really did make this a great (first?) "virtual" OpenWorld.<br>
<br>
<strong>Blogging In Action</strong><br>
By my last count we had 59 "openworld07" articles tagged at <a href=
"http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/openworld07">del.icio.us</a> (37 in the official <a href=
"http://del.icio.us/rss/OracleTechnologyNetwork/openworld07">OTN del.icio.us tag cloud</a>, 43 in Eddie Awad's <a href=
"http://feeds.feedburner.com/oowna">Oracle OpenWorld News Aggregator</a> and 26 tagged via <a href=
"http://www.technorati.com/tag/openworld07">Technorati</a>). And so far 452 photos at <a href=
"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/openworld07/">Flickr</a>.<br>
<br>
I especially enjoyed the detailed conference diaries by <a href=
"http://dgielis.blogspot.com/search/label/oracle%20open%20world">Dimitri Gielis</a>, <a href=
"http://iadvise.blogspot.com/search/label/Oracle%20Open%20World">Nathalie Roman</a> and <a href=
"http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1357-OOW-Day-5.html">Doug Burns</a>. <a href=
"http://awads.net/wp/2007/11/14/so-far-at-oracle-openworld/">Eddie Awad</a> did a great job of community reporting
outside the conference halls. They are just a few I enjoyed - too many other bloggers to mention, but on behalf of all
the "virtual attendees" I thank you all!<br>
<br>
Best Post has however got to be <a href=
"http://dfof.wordpress.com/2007/11/17/oracle-world-and-the-invasion-of-the-sports-jacket/">Oracle World and the
invasion of the sports jacket</a> on what is now one of my favourite blogs by the <em>Sartorially Orientated
Architects</em>!<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Suggestion #1 for the Community - Get our Common Tagging act together</strong> Eddie Awad posted some
  <a href="http://awads.net/wp/2007/11/09/different-ways-to-follow-oracle-openworld-2007/">great tips</a> for
  publishing and following OpenWorld. To be honest though, the adoption has been mixed. I suspect partially because
  there wasn't enough publicity or official sanction given to the ideas. <em>I only noticed Eddie's post today - after
  the conference is over!</em><br>
  <br>
  The most "wired" conference I've attended was <a href="/search/label/iX2007">ix2007</a> in Singapore, where
  instructions for twitter and tagging posts via Technorati were prominently included in the registration materials. It
  would be great to see this getting more official attention at OOW08.<br>
  <br>
  <em>If you blogged about OpenWorld, it's not too late to tag your posts "openworld07" and register with Technorati.
  And if you are reading Openworld articles, keep tagging them on deli.cio.us!</em>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<strong>Podcasts and Streaming</strong><br>
Justin did a bang-up job with the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/syndication/techcasts/index.html">OTN
TechCasts</a> from OpenWorld (can't pick a highlight since they all had great people with really relevant stuff to
say). And it truely is <strong>Open</strong>World when you can catch the <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2007/keynotes.html">keynotes</a> without even attending the conference.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Suggestion #2 - Publish a Podcast Feed for the Keynotes</strong> and it's not too late for Oracle to post
  some feeds for the video, highlights and full audio feeds - with properly tagged audo files! I'm happy to download
  them all individually, but it would have been even more convenient to be able to subscribe to the keynotes feed and
  have them pop up in my iPod as they are published.
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<strong>And now .. the analysis</strong><br>
I guess the one thing we haven't seen a great deal of so far is analysis of what went down at OpenWorld. I'm sure that
will surface over the next weeks and months. My attention was drawn to two key themes..<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Virtualization</strong> The announcement of <a href=
    "http://www.oracle.com/technologies/virtualization/index.html">Oracle VM</a> may prove to be a blockbuster if it is
    widely adopted in practice, I think once it is fully integrated with <a href=
    "http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oem/index.html">Enterprise Manager</a>. It promises to completely change
    the game for how we build and maintain applications and technology infrastructure - from the bare-metal up, from
    one vendor.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fusion Scorecard</strong> the years are ticking by since Oracle played the Fusion card. Vinnie Mirchandani
    is just one who is asking "<a href=
    "http://dealarchitect.typepad.com/deal_architect/2007/11/oracles-missed-.html">Where are the Fusion
    Applications?</a>" For the cynics, the organisational changes in development are just another indicator that Fusion
    is devolving into a Technology/BI story i.e. just futzing around the edges. The optimists however will point out
    that getting the technology platform right is essential, and is not even news (see for example Cliff Godwin's
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/applications/podcast-fusion.html">Fusion AppCast</a> on the <a href=
    "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OracleAppcast/~3/133012314/5728514.mp3">Fusion Strategy Office</a> from
    Jul-07).<br>
    The true test for Oracle will not only be the delivery of appropriately componentized Applications, but the
    business insight it can encapsulate in the platform (hence why it is more important than ever that Oracle
    Development usefully engage the community through events like OpenWorld and the customer advisory boards).<br>
    <strong>It is one thing to enthuse about how bringing Web2.0 and social networking features to CRM will have sales
    people the world over swooning, and quite another to have a head-on collision with the "Real World"!</strong>
  </li>
</ul><br>
<br>
That's all for now. Again, thanks especially to Justin (OTN), Jake and Paul (AppsLab) and the many Oracle bloggers who
turned Oracle OpenWorld 2007 into a global, networked event. Kudos!

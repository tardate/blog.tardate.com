<a href="/2008/06/moving-to-disqus-for-comments.html">It held great promise</a> .. and I think still does .. but I am calling my experiment with Disqus commenting to en end.<br /><br />I've unfortunately had too much feedback that it is just too (friggin) hard for the casual commenter. Bash me upside down, isn't it?<br /><br />I hope the <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> folks to manage to improve the interface to remove any barriers to adoption, because I still do look forward to the day we can wave goodbye to forums, and bring in an era of universally connected discussions!

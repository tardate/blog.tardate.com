        I just discovered the <a href="http://www.sgyoutholympics.com/">online campaign to support Singaporeâ€™s bid for
        the Youth Olympic Games 2010</a>. It would be truely great to see the event held here, and Signapore's
        certainly got the location, facilities, environment and culture to do a great job.<br>
        <br>
        And to be fair, better chances than ever hosting the full Olympic Games!<br>
        <br>
        So I've registered my support, and you'll see the logo flying on my blog from now on;-)<br>
        <br>
        If you want to support the bid on your blog, just <a href="http://www.sgyoutholympics.com/register/">register
        here</a>.<br>

The FQ777-954 and it's derivatives has been a pretty hot item in the nano quadcopter category.
But good technical information is hard to come by beyond the usual product feature specs.
I'm intrigued by the possibilities for building around it, so my first step is to tear one down and
collect as much information about the product as I can.

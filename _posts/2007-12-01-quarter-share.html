        Imagine a Stephenson-esque golden age of clippers, plying the trade routes through space on the solar wind in
        the far distant future. And the story of a young lad learning the ropes and working his way up through the
        ratings.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Nathan Lowell's</strong> <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/quarter-share">Quarter Share</a> is
        the first of a trilogy set in this world, and drips with a sense of mercantile adventure and bonds of
        companionship. This is another great book available as a podcast download from <a href=
        "http://www.podiobooks.com">podiobooks.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        I was sucked in by the details that Mr Lowell packs into the story of Ishmael Wang, Pip and the rest of the
        crew of the Lois McKendrick. Be it scrubbing the urns and tuning the grinder to produce the best possible
        coffee in the galley, or the intricacies of balancing Ish &amp; Pip's trading portfolio.<br>
        <br>
        Loved the book. It has a great feel-good factor, since in this first volume we go along with Ishmael's gradual
        rise-and-rise from greenhorn to well-loved and respected member of the crew.<br>
        <br>
        Gotta download the next volume, <strong>Half Share</strong>, PDQ!<br>

I've taken apart and had enough "wall wart" power supplies blow up on me .. so perhaps it is about time to put one together instead!

Cheap kits are available, although it pays to carefully map out the circuit and understand how it functions,
as schematics don't always match PCB/silkscreen, and components may also vary!
The kit I've built here works just fine..

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

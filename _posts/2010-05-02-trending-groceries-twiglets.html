In Australia, kids are called <span style="font-style:italic;">vegemites</span> in honour of that most delicious of
gastronomic inventions - yeast extract. In the UK, children have Marmite. Is it the same? Better? The debate rages.<br>
<br>
Bitter &amp; salty - whether you bat for the Vegemite or Marmite team, kids can't get enough of it. Which is really
weird when you consider these are the same kids who baulk at a single brussel sprout or any cheese that hasn't had all
hint of character resoundly flogged out of it.<br>
<br>
In 1929, some <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_invented_Twiglets">clever bastard</a> (M. Rondalin) realized you
can't run around all day with a slice of bread in your hand and had the genius idea of baking convenient little
breadsticks smothered in yeast extract. Twiglets were born and the rest is history..<br>
<br>
The problem is that unless you live in one of those yeast-extract addicted countries, Twiglets are as rare to find as,
well, yeast extract.<br>
<br>
So when I find them on a supermarket shelf, they are a must buy. I emptied the shelf at a local <a href=

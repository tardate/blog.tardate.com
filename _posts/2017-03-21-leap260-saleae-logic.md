I recently had a Saleae Logic fall into my hands - it's an old model and was looking for a good home.
It is a 24 MS/s 8 channel logic analyzer, not the greatest specs these days but quite adequate for me.
I was pretty impressed - up and running in 30 seconds, and using a Mac too!
Saleae have done a brilliant job of creating an excellent experience, and continuing to support their discontinued products.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Run <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gource/">gource</a> on a source code repository and it animates the code's
evolution. I think I first saw it used to illustrate the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPk1BqK8zzI">history
of Python development since 1990</a>, and I must admit my first reaction was <i>cool but probably pointless</i>.<br>
<br>
Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dmm6319">@dmm6319</a> ran it over our own project, and inspired me to play
around a bit with it too.<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://youtu.be/6z_7VO3RPn8" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="228" width=
  "400" src="/assets/2012-05-27-gource-cool-and-not-totally-pointless/babylish-04-May-2012.png"></a>
</div><br>
So after watching our animation a few times I'm sheepishly revising my opinion of gource.<br>
<br>
Yes, you probably need to have something invested in the particular code-base to care, and it certainly helps if you
avoid the obvious cliche of using an "atmospheric" soundtrack.<br>
<br>
But there are some real, big-picture insights that come through very clearly in the animation that you wouldn't
necessarily get if you just looked at the source - for example, the shift from Cucumber to RSpec as our primary testing
framework.<br>

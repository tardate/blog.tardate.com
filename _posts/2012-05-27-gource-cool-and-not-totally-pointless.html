Run <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gource/">gource</a> on a source code repository and it animates the code's evolution. I think I first saw it used to illustrate the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPk1BqK8zzI">history of Python development since 1990</a>, and I must admit my first reaction was <i>cool but probably pointless</i>.<br /><br />Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dmm6319">@dmm6319</a> ran it over our own project, and inspired me to play around a bit with it too.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://youtu.be/6z_7VO3RPn8" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="228" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTrOfKwgUfY/T8F_5yEQ4YI/AAAAAAAACJE/MsQpdoO0q8w/s400/babylish-04-May-2012.png" /></a></div><br />So after watching our animation a few times I'm sheepishly revising my opinion of gource.<br /><br />Yes, you probably need to have something invested in the particular code-base to care, and it certainly helps if you avoid the obvious cliche of using an "atmospheric" soundtrack.<br /><br />But there are some real, big-picture insights that come through very clearly in the animation that you wouldn't necessarily get if you just looked at the source - for example, the shift from Cucumber to RSpec as our primary testing framework. <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blogarhythm: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168LEB4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00168LEB4">Asik Veysel - Joe Satriani</a></span>

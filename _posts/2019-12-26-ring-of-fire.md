The usual cloud cover and a simple handphone camera didn't make for the
most scientifically accurate images of the
[26 December 2019 Annular Solar Eclipse](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2019-december-26),
but after pushing all the filters to 10, this snap from my window in Singpore is perhaps
more interesting for it!

I remember seeing my first [solar eclipse in 1976](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/1976-october-23)
standing on the beach in Melbourne. The transition from full summer sunkist to an eerie dusk
was exhilarating for my young mind pumped up on school projects about eclipses, pinhole cameras and the like.

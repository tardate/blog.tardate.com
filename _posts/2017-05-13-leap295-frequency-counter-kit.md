Not that I really need another frequency counter, but it is interesting to see how this one is constructed.
[Julian Ilett has a video on a similar kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhb0MjQBvNo) and his investigation of the circuit was thorough,
including the discovery that the kits available are deritative from original work by Wolfgang "Wolf" BÃ¼scher, DL4YHF
(see [Frequency counter with a PIC and minimum hardware](http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/freq_counter/freq_counter.html)).
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

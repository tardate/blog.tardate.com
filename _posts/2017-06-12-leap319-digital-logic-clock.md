This digital clock module was [designed by Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmQ5K7UQPMM) as part of his 8-bit computer build.
It is also an interesting demonstration of the 555 timer in all its major modes of operation.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

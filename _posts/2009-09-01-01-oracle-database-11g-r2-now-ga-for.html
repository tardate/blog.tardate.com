Oracle has released <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/oracle11g/index.html">Oracle Database 11g R2</a> today - currently only the Linux version, with other OS to follow.<br /><br />The 11gR2 documentation is not yet available on OTN or for download yet, but I note it is <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/db112/homepage">already available online</a> if you want to stay up tonight to digest all that's new. Chris Kanaracus' <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/171192/oracle_11g_r2_makes_its_debut.html">PCWorld review</a> is one of the first to hit the streets.<br /><br />I've yet to digest all the changes, but in general I'd call this a "refinement" release after what's been a very solid initial 11g release. It is interseting to see the cloud features creeping in though, for example <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10881/chapter1.htm#FEATURENO08752">backup to Amazon S3</a>.<br /><br />11g R1 has now been out for about two years, and while technically it was the "polish" needed to round out the major shift to 10g, my personal experience is that 11g adoption has been pretty slow, and mainly the result of fresh installs rather than upgrades. This is to be expected given that most customers fit into one of two camps: those <span style="font-style:italic;">still</span> stuck on pre-10g, and those who finally got it and moved to 10g (few of whom are yet keen to regroup for a move to 11g). Apparently, Oracle estimates about 10-20% of customers have implemented 11g which sounds about right.<br /><br />As fitting my tradition (going back to a very old and tired joke), this means the tardate blog gets a +0.1 increment. w00t!

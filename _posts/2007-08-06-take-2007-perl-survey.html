Take part in the 2007 Perl Survey! The Perl Survey is an attempt to capture a picture of the Perl community in all its diversity.  No matter what sort of Perl programmer you are, they'd love to hear from you.<br /><br />The survey can be found at: <a href="http://perlsurvey.org/">http://perlsurvey.org/</a><br /><br />It only takes about 5 minutes to complete, and will be open until September 30th, 2007.

<a href="http://embedded.fm/">embedded.fm</a> has fast become my favourite podcast of the moment (always excepting
<a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/question-of-the-day/">QOTD</a>). Great ideas shared in an inclusive and warm-fuzzy
way.<br>
<br>
Elecia's end-of-show quote always makes it worth listening right to the end. Until I heard <a href=
"http://embedded.fm/episodes/146">#146's</a>,<br>
I'd struggled to find words to express exactly this. It's a quote from <a href=
"https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2jop36/a_human_being_should_be_able_to_change_a_diaper/">Robert A.
Heinlein</a>:<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building,
  write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate,
  act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
  efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.<br>
</blockquote>

Just another audio effects chip. this time a simple dorbell effect.
The effect is very similar to - and not any more pleasant! - than the kind of effect you can get with common two-tone 555 circuits.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">Peter Cochrane's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184112477X?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=184112477X">Uncommon Sense</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=184112477X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is an interesting collection of opinion pieces taken from his silicom.com blog through to around 2004. While you can read much of the material (and catch later articles) in his <a href="http://www.cochrane.org.uk/opinion/articles/silicon/index.php">blog archives</a>, the book does enhance the content will a liberal scattering of charts and also some additional commentary.<br /><br />Some of the topics are evergreen, such as the failures of the education system, and the gap that often exists between the actual and the perceived in conventional wisdom. Some are specific to a point in time, like his pre-occupation with the 3G bandwidth auction debacle.<br /><br />Certainly worth grabbing a copy for a thought provoking read, and ample encouragement to add his blog to my reader for continued entertainment.<br /><br />Cochrane also has a nice practice of introducing many of his articles with a related quote. One of my favourites is from Douglas Adams:<br /><blockquote class="quote">Technology is the name we give to stuff that doesn't work properly yet.</blockquote></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=184112477X&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

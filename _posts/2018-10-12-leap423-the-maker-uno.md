I was recently shown an Arduino-compatible board made by Cytron in Penang, Malaysia.
It packs quite a few additional features in the Uno form-factor:

* LEDs on all digital pins
* a piezo buzzer on pin 8
* a push-button on pin 2

Aside from looking pretty spiffy, a really nice feature is the price - currently listing for
RM15 ([~$3.60 USD](https://www.google.com/search?q=myr+15+in+usd))!

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Here's a quick demo sketch that exercises the LEDs, buzzer and push-button:

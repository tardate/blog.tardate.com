This is a quick and dirty implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on the
[Boldport Matrix](../TheMatrix), mainly to learn a bit more about using the AS1130 LED driver.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">Moving on to some fantasy after the hard sci-fi of <a href="http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2008/01/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>...<br /><br /><strong>Magician: Apprentice</strong> was <a href="http://www.crydee.com/">Raymond E. Feist's</a> bestselling opener for his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riftwar_Saga">Riftwar Saga</a>. First published in 1982, I read the 10th anniversary "author's preferred edition" (I gather that basically means he now has the stature to override the original editor's cuts;-)<br /><br />Fantasy isn't normally my preferred reading material, but I really enjoyed this. Sure the scale is epic, but unlike Tolkien, Feist keeps the pace up and gory action a-plenty. And I'm looking forward to following Pug's development as a magician. Unlike the fast-food, just-get-the-pronunciation-right approach of Harry Potter, magic in this world is <em>hard</em>.<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0553564943&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></tbody></table>

Moving on to some fantasy after the hard sci-fi of <a href=
"/2008/01/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4lmBdDd" class="book-title">Magician: Apprentice</a>
was <a href="http://www.crydee.com/">Raymond E. Feist's</a> bestselling
opener for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riftwar_Saga">Riftwar Saga</a>. First published in
1982, I read the 10th anniversary "author's preferred edition" (I gather that basically means he now has the
stature to override the original editor's cuts;-)<br>
<br>
Fantasy isn't normally my preferred reading material, but I really enjoyed this. Sure the scale is epic, but
unlike Tolkien, Feist keeps the pace up and gory action a-plenty. And I'm looking forward to following Pug's
development as a magician. Unlike the fast-food, just-get-the-pronunciation-right approach of Harry Potter,
magic in this world is <em>hard</em>.<br>

Parsing delimited text that may have quoted elements is a perennial requirement. Quick-and-dirty parses can be achieved
with regular expressions, but for more flexible and encapsulated parsing I've been checking out the <a href=
"http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/">opencsv</a> java library. <em>Hat tip to <a href="http://kuba.zilp.pl/?id=361">Jakub
Pawlowski</a> for highlighting the library on his blog</em><br>
<br>
<strong>A Regular Expression Approach</strong><br>
Just recently I released and blogged about a <a href="/2008/01/jdeveloper-filter-add-in.html">JDeveloper Filter
Add-in</a>, and it contains a class called ExecShell [<a href=
"http://jdevfilter.sourceforge.net/api/tardate/execshell/ExecShell.html">API</a>, <a href=
"http://jdevfilter.cvs.sourceforge.net/jdevfilter/jdevfilter/src/tardate/execshell/ExecShell.java?view=markup">source</a>]
which needs to know how to break a command line into its component arguments. The command line is of course
space-delimited, but may use quotes to group an argument with embedded spaces (so a simple split on spaces won't
do).<br>
<br>
The salient code below uses the <span class="code">REGEX</span> to chop <span class="code">theCmdLine</span> String
into <span class="code">theCmdArray</span> Vector of arguments:<br>
<blockquote class="code">
  Vector&lt;String&gt; theCmdArray = new Vector&lt;String&gt;(0);<br>
  String REGEX = "\"([^\"]+?)\"\\s?|([^\\s]+)\\s?|\\s";<br>
  Pattern p = Pattern.compile(REGEX);<br>
  Matcher m = p.matcher(theCmdLine);<br>
  while (m.find())<br>
  {<br>
  theCmdArray.add( m.group().trim() );<br>
  }
</blockquote><br>
The regular expression bears a little explaining, and is inspired by <a href=
"http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Development-Class/SimpledemoofCSVmatchingusingRegularExpressions.htm">this
example</a>. Here's how it breaks down:<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="code"><br>
      \"([^\"]+?)\"\\s?</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      Matches a group within double-quotes. Group is a lazy match on one or more characters except double-quote.
      Optionally followed by some whitespace
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="code">|([^\\s]+)\\s?</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      or Matches a group delimited by whitespace, optionally followed by some whitespace
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="code">|\\s</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      Discards a pure whitespace match
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
In this case, we are using whitespace as the delimiter (appropriate for command lines). The regex can be adapted for
other delimiters by replacing <span class="code">\\s</span> with the delimiter. For example, to handle a
comma-separated format:<br>
<blockquote class="code">
  String REGEX = "\"([^\"]+?)\",?|([^,]+),?|,";<br>
</blockquote><br>
<strong>Using OpenCSV</strong><br>
The same space-delimited parsing requirement can be met with a couple of lines and the <a href=
"http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/">opencsv</a> library:<br>
<blockquote class="code">
  CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new StringReader(theCmdArray), ' ');<br>
  String[] s = reader.readNext();
</blockquote><br>
Simple, yet currently not so robust. Since we define the delimiter to be a single space (over-ridding the default
comma), other whitespace characters (like a tab) will not be recognised. Further, repeated spaces will not be
coalesced, but will each be treated as the delimiter for a new element.<br>
<br>
Internally, <span class="code">CSVReader</span> parses the input character-by-character and so adapting to handle
repeated delimiters as one would be reasonably straight-forward.

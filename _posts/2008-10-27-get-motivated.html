I hate motivation books; all that sickly rah-rah and exultations that you too can be like Donald Trump if you
just repeat to yourself three times: "I am a success. I am a genius. People love me."<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.justinherald.com/">Justin Herald</a>'s book <a href=
"https://amzn.to/44fU9wN" class="book-title">Get Motivated</a> is refreshingly
different, and a thought-provoking read. You may find it in the bookstore in the "Management Self-help Guru"
section, but it is probably better classified under sociology.<br>
<br>
This is about common sense philosophy for real people. Justin Herald tells it like it is, and sometimes you
might not like it (ethics are important? you gotta actually work hard? Jeez!).<br>
<br>
Here's a selection of chapter headings<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contender or pretender?
  </li>
  <li>Victim of victor?
  </li>
  <li>Stickability
  </li>
  <li>You set your standards
  </li>
  <li>The sad passing of common sense
  </li>
  <li>Your future is not in your past
  </li>
  <li>Don't just do something ... sit there! <span style="font-style:italic;">(my favourite quote)</span>
  </li>
</ul>

He touches repeatedly on the idea of setting your own moral and professional standards and then not letting
yourself be swayed or pushed into accepting less.<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.
</blockquote><br>
This reminded me of another great quote from Anthony Bourdain on <a href=
"http://www.chefsstory.com/thechefs.html">Chef's Story</a>:<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  My best advice if you are starting out and want to be a success: set yourself high standards and stick to them.
</blockquote>(or words to that effect ...)<br>
<br>
A refreshing read, and highly recommended. It may be just what you need to get a fresh perspective and work towards
being a more positive life. Or not. I'll leave you with <a href="http://stickgal.blogspot.com">The Bitter Stick
Girl's</a> brilliant observation:<br>

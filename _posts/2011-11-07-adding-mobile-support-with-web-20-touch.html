The quest for an ideal javascript framework for mobile web applications has been a bit of a work-in-progress for some time (at least if you cared about cross-platform). <br /><br />You might have got started (like me) with Jonathan Stark's excellent books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805780/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0596805780">Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596805780&camp=217145&creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449383262/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=itsaprli-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1449383262">Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=itsaprli-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449383262&camp=217145&creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and maybe tried the <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> framework that these spawned. Meanwhile, the official <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery mobile framework</a> has slowly been moving to fruition.<br /><br />I recently discovered another project - <a href="https://github.com/web20boom/Web-2.0-Touch">Web 2.0 Touch</a> - that is pitched as a mini framework with better features and more ease of use than jQTouch. Since I had a little side-project underway that could benefit from mobile support, I thought I'd give it a test drive.<br /><br />And I was duly impressed. In just a few hours, I had a full and distinct mobile version of the site. Better yet, I didn't run into any weird behaviours that can plague mobile development. It just worked.<br /><br />Now I'm not going to stop tracking the jQuery Mobile project or other solutions like <a href="http://rhomobile.com/">Rhomobile</a>, but if all you need is a quick, functional and good looking mobile view, then Web 2.0 Touch is well worth a look.<br /><br />The <a href="http://noagendadashboard.com/"><b>NoAgenda Attack Vector Dashboard</b></a> is the project I used Web 2.0 Touch for, and if you want to see all the intricate details of how I made the site mobile-friendly -  you can! The entire site is open sourced and available on <br /><a href="https://github.com/tardate/noagenda_dashboard">GitHub</a>. I'll just describe a couple of the features here...<br /><br /><h3>Differentiated Views</h3>The first has not much to do with Web 2.0 Touch per se, and is more just a demonstration of how easy it is to work with a range of view technologies in Rails.<br /><br />Since the application has a very specific and rich desktop presentation, I knew the mobile version was going to be very different. Here are the desktop and mobile "home pages" side-by-side:<br /> <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://noagendadashboard.com/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="181" width="400" src="/assets/noagendadashboard_side-by-side.png" /></a></div><br />Rather than weigh down view code with lots of conditionals, I decided to use the MIME-type method of differentiation.<br /><br />If you haven't used this before, it essentially means registering a suitable MIME-type (I called it <i>mobile</i>), and in the main ApplicationController, the request.format is set to this type if the client is detected to require the special mobile view. Now a request to an :index page will render with index.mobile.erb (or index.mobile.haml as is my preference), while the non-mobile view will render with index.html.erb / index.html.haml.<br /><br />I've added the <a href="https://github.com/fnando/browser">browser</a> gem to the project for device identification, and for this app I've decided to only specifically handle iPhone and Android. I also don't give these phones a desktop view alternative, since I know it is not going to be nice. <br /><pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols"># config/initializers/mime_types.rb:<br />Mime::Type.register_alias "text/html", :mobile<br /><br /># application_controller.rb:<br />class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base<br />  before_filter { request.format = :mobile if (browser.iphone? || browser.android?) }<br />end<br /></pre>With that in place, my *.mobile.haml view and layout files just need to focus on rendering the mobile site.<br /><br /><h3>Page Transitions</h3>The jsTouch.loadPage method is used to load and navigate pages in the Web 2.0 Touch framework. <br /><br />In the application, I've made this 'unobtrusive' so it might be worth pointing out what is going on. The .touch_load class is used to tag items that should initiate a page transition. The data-url and data-transition attributes tell it where to go and what transition animation to use.<br /><pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">.toolbar<br />  %h1= t('.title')<br />  %a.button.back.touch_load{'data-url' =&gt; menu_dashboard_path, 'data-transition' =&gt; 'pop-out' }= t(:done)<br />.content<br />  = render :partial =&gt; 'notes/table'</pre>The <i>enableSmartphonePageLoad</i> function runs during page load to setup the behaviour:<br /><pre name="code" class="ruby:wraplines:nocontrols">  enableSmartphonePageLoad: function() {<br />    $('.touch_load').live('click', function() {<br />      var url = $(this).data('url') || $(this).attr('href');<br />      var transition = $(this).data('transition') || 'slide-left';<br />      if (url != "") {<br />        jsTouch.loadPage(url, { transition: transition });<br />      }<br />      return false;<br />    });<br />  },<br /></pre><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blogarhythm: <a href="http://youtu.be/VNgcrXXgGfw">Touch - Noiseworks</a></span>

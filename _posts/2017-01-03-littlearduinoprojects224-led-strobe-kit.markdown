Stocking stuffers like this 555/4017 LED strobe kit almost always present interesting challenges/learning opportunities.
[Julian Ilett had fun re-wiring the same kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyp4Jq8a3Y).
For myself, I found out the PCB appeared to have the supplied transistors connected upside down,
and some adjustments to the resistor values yielded a better effect.

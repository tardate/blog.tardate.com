As usual, Jeff cuts to the heart of the matter on Coding Horror when <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001128.html">calling out Yelp</a> for the astonishingly evil and unconscionable act of asking users to hand over their email passwords.<br /><br />I am not sure who started this, but it has <span style="font-weight:bold;">somehow scarily become accepted practice</span>, especially among the social networking sites. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo </a>... they all do it, and seem to think that waving some privacy mumbo-jumbo <span style="font-style:italic;">'but you can trust US!'</span> makes it OK.  Some are particularly heinous, like <a href="http://www.tagged.com/">Tagged</a>, which <a href="http://jivlain.wordpress.com/2007/04/30/hello-mr-website-would-you-like-my-password/">obscure the fact that handing over your email password is optional</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SEhuj37Yl7I/AAAAAAAAAV4/WX7ntjN-maY/s1600-h/email-keys-2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/SEhuj37Yl7I/AAAAAAAAAV4/WX7ntjN-maY/s400/email-keys-2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5208534531641481138" /></a><br />As many have pointed out (see the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001128.html">comments on Jeff's post</a>), this is a lazy solution to a problem that is solvable in ways that do not need to compromise user security. <br /><br />Facebook, LinkedIn - these guys should know better. And I think have an obligation to do better, especially since it is becoming more and more common for a social networking site to be an individual's first experience on the net. While the old hands may have well-ingrained security awareness thanks to the evangelizing efforts of people like Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte on the <a href="http://twit.tv/sn">Security Now!</a> podcast, we have a whole new generation of users being taught <span style="font-weight:bold;">exactly the wrong thing</span> thanks to the misguided and irresponsible acts of the social networking sites that are requesting email passwords to be handed over.<br /><br />The proliferation of this perfidious practice must be reversed! A good first step is to heap professional scorn on anyone associated with developing such a feature. Shame!

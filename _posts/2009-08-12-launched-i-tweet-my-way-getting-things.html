Quitting smoking, losing weight, paying off the credit card, or learning a new skill - these (and anything else you can imagine) are all suitable objectives to set yourself with <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://itweetmyway.com">I Tweet My Way</a></span>.<br /><br />I've had a long-standing interest in goal setting and tracking, but I must admit it was the advent of the "twitter-application" fad that got me thinking about how you could do a "getting things done" style personal trainer with Twitter. Now I'm looking forward to see how it gets used for real. I'm very interested in any feedback you may have. Did it help? Does it work? Why didn't it help or fit your needs? <br /><br />Technically, it was built with rails and uses the Twitter OAuth support for authentication (you can <a href="/2009/06/using-twitter-oauth-with-rails-sample.html">read more about that here</a>). I have it hosted at <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a> (my favourite rails hosting service, although I am a bit leary about performance in the Asian region at the moment).<br /><br />NB: the site currently comes without soundtrack, but think "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOw6mxiPiIA">mbube, the lion sleeps tonight</a>";-)

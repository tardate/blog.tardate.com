The H-83A is yet another music chip, this time programmed with 12 tunes.
I haven't figured out all the songs, but they sound like classic Chinese folk tunes.

This chip requires very minimal external components (resistor, switch and power),
but volume is decent in all it's 8-bit wonder!

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

Back in 99, I spent about six months procrastinating over a MAJOR decision (or so it seemed at the time).<br /><br />To stick with the Microsoft camp - where I'd built up substantial experience through ActiveX to DCOM to COM, IIS and Commerce Server 3.0 - or jump onto the Java bandwagon?<br /><br />Ultimately, Java won out, and along with millions of others, we've made Java the enterprise platform of choice (arguably).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2311908584_f11014517e.jpg?v=0"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2311908584_f11014517e.jpg?v=0" border="0" alt="" /></a>The interesting point upon reflection, is that there was never any doubt in my mind that Java was somehow 'better' and more 'pure', in an academic sense.<br /><br />Almost ten years later, I shocked myself recently when returning to Java after spending a good part of the past two years infatuated with ruby and rails and other scripting languages.<br /><br />Where before I saw classical elegance, now my first thoughts were <span style="font-style:italic;">this sux</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">the language is just getting in my way</span>. <br /><br />First the verbosity kills me:<br /><pre name="code" class="java:wraplines:nocontrols"><br />   WeLikeLongDescriptiveClassNames myReallyDescriptivelyNamedObject = WeLikeLongDescriptiveClassNamesFactory.getInstance(duh);<br /></pre ><br />How many times do I have to tell the compiler what kind of object I am dealing with? Sure, I understand the benefits of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">Factory pattern</a> and the subtleties you can construct by virtue of the inheritance hierarchy. But most of the time, I just want the compiler to do what is most obvious, and don't make me write a novel for the most straight-forward tasks!<br /><br />Then there's the language-promoted cultural phenomenon of class explosion. Need half a dozen value objects to represent the various information to be passed around in your domain? Sure! With unit tests all, I am sure. Most of the time, I'd now prefer to scream <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a>!<br /><br />But the true ephiphany was my run-in with primitives (again ... every year or so). Using JSP sessions as a perfect place to test this out. Take an int and stick it in the session:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="java:wraplines:nocontrols"><br />int startingInt = 3;<br />session.setAttribute( "startingInt" , startingInt);<br /></pre ><br />What type is in the session? An Integer object of course. Java has cleverly done a type conversion for you, from a primitive to an object. But woe betide the simple developer who assumes this must be a commutative operation:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="java:wraplines:nocontrols"><br />int newInt = session.getAttribute( "startingInt" );<br />// Error!! <br /></pre ><br />That's what I call a language actively getting in your way. Kind of like if you deposited $10 cash in your bank, but when you went to withdraw the money, the teller threw the shutters down and said you could only get your money back in government bonds. <br /><br />So do I have a point or is this just a rant (and certainly one that is not as erudite as <a href="http://blog.beplacid.net/2007/09/03/why-java-is-obsolete/">many have written</a>)?<br /><br />I guess I must be pretty slow to catch on to what others knew long ago. The true test comes down to being able to realise one's goals. For personal projects, I find I'm able to knock out complete (and impressive) applications in Rails, while I still have ten java-based ideas on the drawing board.<br /><br />It comes down to whatever works. And it should. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_512_BB"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 220px;" src="http://www.ferraris-online.com/cars/FE-512BB-27001/images/P000Fade.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Does that mean I <span style="font-style:italic;">hate</span> Java? Not at all. I still get a bit of a thrill out of its clean lines and voluminous open source library support. Much like seeing an aging and long-since outclassed 512BB. 'Classic' is timeless.<br /><br />No. I don't hate Java, but neither do I love it the way it used to demand. I look back on my na√Øve 1999-self in wonder. Building experience is key, but it is a mistake to tie this to a language. Computer languages are the tools of our trade, and the more you know, the better you will be. When people mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)">Eiffel</a> ... do you know what they are on about, or do you just nod intelligently and pray not to get caught out?<br /><br />With more tools at our disposal, we are better able to tackle new challenges in the most appropriate way. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">To get the job done</span> (which is generally the point, right?).

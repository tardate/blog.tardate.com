<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top">I forget the first time I became aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Sessions">Roger Sessions</a>. I think a collegue of mine in the .com days might have had him as a lecturer. Certainly I got on his <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/">ObjectWatch</a> newsletter some time back.<br /><br />I picked up <strong>Software Fortresses</strong> - <em>Modeling Enterprise Architectures</em> from the library and it is an interesting read. While I don't see too much evidence that the methodology expoused by the book has been adopted by the mainstream, it is a book that is worth reading for some of the ideas none-the-less.<br /><br />Principle among these is the idea that system boundries should be seen in the context of organisational dynamics. In other words, if your organisation goes for a centralised database structure and that is unlikely to change in the near term, then it makes sense to model  and build your systems that way. This is a great insight as far as I am concerned. It is too easy to be seduced by the idea that IT folk are hyper-rational geeks, and forget the reality that we are all just as human as the rest. Anyone who has tried to implement a system for real can attest to the fact that often it is the human factor that is the primary determinant of success.<br /><br />The last chapter ("Postlude") is worth the price of the book itself. Here it lists a series of <em>Top-10s</em> such as <ul><br /><li>Ten Important Points about Software Fortresses</li><br /><li>Ten Reasons to Adopt the Software Fortress Model</li><br /><li>Ten Rules for Software Fortress Design</li><ul><br /><li>At the enterprise level, focus on treaties (between fortresses)</li><br /><li>Define fortresses with the right amount of granularity</li><br /><li>Look carefully at your walls (for security implications especailly)</li><br /><li>Look carefully at your guards</li><br /><li>Make sure nobody can exit the fortress except through an envoy</li><br /><li>Design infograms to be resilient</li><br /><li>Design your fortress to scale</li><br /><li>Use only losely coupled transations across fortresses</li><br /><li>Use tightly coupled transations only within the fortress</li><br /><li>Use asynchronous drawbridges wherever possible</li></ul><br /><li>Ten Controversial Ideas within the Sofftware Fortress Model</li><ul><br /><li>Performance doesn't count (as much as the overall design)</li><br /><li>Put security only in the guard</li><br /><li><strong>Organisational boundaries are related to fortress boundaries</strong></li><br /><li>Tightly coupled transactions shouldn't cross fortress boundaries</li><br /><li>We need fortresses within fortresses</li><br /><li>The software fortress model should always be used</li><br /><li>Turn off database security(!)</li><br /><li>Don't share databases across fortresses</li><br /><li>Give scale-out priority to scale-up</li><br /><li>The model hasn;t been proven (but what has?)</li></ul><br /><li>Ten Considerations for Evaluating J2EE versus .NET</li><br /><li>Ten Observations on the State of the Software Industry</li><ul><br /><li>The industry has no conceptual model for building enterprise systems</li><br /><li>The software industry lacks a coherent vision for flowing transactions through the enterprise</li><br /><li>The software industry has a confusing hodgepodge of security capabilities and no model for how they should be used</li><br /><li>The software industry is wasting time defining portability standards when what we need are interoperability standards</li><br /><li>The software industry does not differentiate among implementation technologies (such as objects), distribution technologies (such as components), and interoperability technologies (such as fortresses)</li><br /><li>The software industry has no concept of the difference between the communications that must occur within a system and the communications that must occur between systems</li><br /><li>The software industry does not have a common model for interoperability, so different vendors create products that are difficult to glue together</li><br /><li>The software industry uses technology-specific terminology for describing what is being done, making it difficult to udnerstand when common approaches are being used (e.g. session beans v. COM+ components)</li><br /><li>The software industry assumes that interoperability will be solved by the choice of one single technology that will integrate everything</li><br /><li>The software industry frequently provides capabilities that are not only not useful, but downright harmful (examples include entity beans, distrubuted objects, Microsofts Transation Internet Protocol)</li></ul></ul><br />The book was published in 2003, but I think we see some sign that the challenges expresed by Mr sessions may well be being addressed - such as the wide-spread adoption of SOAP/Web Services. Mr Sessions words do however spell a warning to those who try to overload such technologies with too much intre-fortress baggage.<br /></td><br /><td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><iframe src="https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=itsaprli-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0321166086&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

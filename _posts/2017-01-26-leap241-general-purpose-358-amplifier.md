summary:        Is this a decent general-purpose LM358 amplifier circuit? Turns out, not so much!

There's always room on my bench for another general purpose amplifier.
This is another LM358-based Op-Amp audio amplifier circuit, but it turns
out to be not so useful. As-is, it suffers from two issues.
First R8=1MÎ© provides ridiculous gain, so most signals over 50mV or so slam to upper/lower output limits.
Second, the push-pull output stage can't deliver much power.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

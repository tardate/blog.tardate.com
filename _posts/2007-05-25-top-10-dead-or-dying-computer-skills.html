I try to avoid postings that just refer you to other blogs or articles, but I've succumbed. ComputerWorld's <a href=

The top 10 dead (or dying) computer skills</a> prompted a bit of nostalgia. I scored 91% [giving myself 1% for the time
I bought a book on COBOL while at uni ... and had the good sense to take it no further than that!!].<br>

which I was also reminded when I first checked out Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch">code search</a>
and found some of my <a href=
"http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;q=show:QhNUMMFho4s:RDILhlfYSkY:xox6G3YDbew&amp;sa=N&amp;ct=rd&amp;cs_p=http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/wps/css10.zip&amp;cs_f=/CSS.CPP">
1995 OS/2 code</a> lying around! [NB: these days, I look at this code and shudder "Eek!... buffer overflow
vulnerability!!" ... security just wasn't front of mind back then! ]. But it also reminds me of how much thought I put
into the decision to adopt C++ on OS/2. It very much felt like "this is a decision that I'll live with for years". But
12 years later, in 2007, that decision-making process seems so naive and foreign. Now it is routine to dabble in a
couple of scripting languages, some Java, even some C++. The right (or most fun) tool for the job, right?<br>
<br>
If I could say "Programming Language Bigotry" is a skill (some people certainly practiced and honed it like it was),
then boy am I glad it seems to be a thing of the past and perhaps it deserves to be #1 in this list!<br>
<br>
After a brief post-dot-boom hiatus, the drammatic rate of evolution is certainly back, spurred on by Web 2.0 hype. The
rate of technological change has indeed become so "normal" that a top 10 list hardly scratches the surface. Personally
I would have voted for <a href="http://spike.scu.edu.au/~barry/interrupts.html">int 21h</a>. I'm sure generations to
come will have absolutely no idea what that means, but for me and presumably many others, I can sum up a year of
computer science with that very phrase.<br>
<br>
For many (myself included), <strong>To Be Alive is To Be Learning</strong> and vice versa. The new religion if you
will. "Lifelong learning" or "learning for life" are too trite and miss the essential truth.<br>
<br>
Other may say that to be continuously learning is to be in a perpetual state of childhood. Look at some of the <a href=
"http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">toys</a> we are learning about and maybe they have a point!<br>

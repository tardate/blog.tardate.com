[Pailin's Hot Thai Kitchen](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/) has added so many wonderful recipes that
frequently appear on our table.
It didn't take much convincing to have a go at the latest recipe I'd seen,
[Chili Lime Peanuts (ถั่วทอดสมุนไพร, Tua Tod Samun Prai)](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/chili-herb-nuts/).

How did it go?
Well let's say I kept downsizing my storage container requirements.
As we were warned, these are indeed very addictive!

I followed the basic recipe, the main variation
being that I left out the cashews, and used
[Knorr Serbuk Pati (Seasoning Powder - Chicken) from NTUC Fairprice](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/knorr-stock-powder-%E2%80%93-chicken-120g-308371)
in place of "chicken bouillon". I'm not sure if these are actually
similar products, but it worked just fine.

My ingredient list:

* Frying oil (canola)
* 10 large cloves garlic, peeled
* 15 makrut lime leaves, large
* 1 stalk lemongrass
* 10 dried chilies, chopped
    * [Pasar Dried Chilies](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/pasar-dried-chillies-value-pack-150g-13088595)
* 400g raw peanuts
    * [Pasar Raw Peanuts from NTUC Fairprice](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/pasar-raw-peanuts-800g-13101694)
    * (peanuts fried for 7-8 mins)

And for the seasoning:

* 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
    * I used brown sugar, as no white sugar on hand
* 1½ teaspoon table salt
* 1 teaspoon lime juice powder
    * [Knorr Lime Flavoured Powder](https://www.unileverfoodsolutions.com.sg/en/product/knorr-lime-flavoured-powder-400g-1-EN-694361.html)
* 1 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder, optional but recommended
    * [Knorr Serbuk Pati (Seasoning Powder - Chicken) from NTUC Fairprice](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/knorr-stock-powder-%E2%80%93-chicken-120g-308371)
* 2 teaspoon chili powder
    * I used [Korean Gochugaru](https://shopee.sg/product/221176277/22656741097)

Highly recommend. You may want to consider doubling all the quantities though!

No matter how they're viewed at home, the BBC remains in my view the international gold standard for news, information,
and entertainment. God bless'em. And could you imagine any other "news organisation" (a.k.a. pernicious purveyors of
distracting deceits) going so far as to require ".. inline links must go to primary sources onlyâ€“ eg scientific journal
article or policy report .. " in their <a href=

<br>
You can find a brilliant argument for why this might be a good idea in Ben Goldacre's book <a href=

Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks</a> which I've recently read and cannot recommend too highly
for anyone with half a brain. <br>

Update 17-Oct-2011: Ben Goldacre had a good rant
about Bad Science at TED this year:

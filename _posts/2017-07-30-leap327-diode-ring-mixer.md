A DIY build of a double-balanced diode ring frequency mixer, inspired by another
[video from w2aew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=junuEwmQVQ8)
and the endless treasure-trove that is [Experimental Methods in RF Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2386153.Experimental_Methods_in_RF_Design).
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

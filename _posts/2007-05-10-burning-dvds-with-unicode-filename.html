I have quite an eclectic music collection, which grew considerably last year when I spent quite a bit of time in Tokyo. My favourite Sunday afternoon haunt was HMV @ Times Square, checking out the Shunjuku South indie chart. A suitcase of CDs later, I finally got around to ripping my entire CD collection and adding it my old ripped vinyl collection. All nicely organised, named and categorised in iTunes. <br /><br />Feeling very pleased with myself, I wanted to archive all my hard work onto a set of DVDs, only to find that my (Windows-based) recording software baulked at the Japanese, Korean and Chinese characters in the folder and filenames.<br /><br />My first thought .. should just need to change the file system format? But it didn't take long to discover it wasn't so simple. In fact, of the half a dozen different disk burning softwares I ended up trying out (including most of the "major" names), all but one failed to handle my babel of disks correctly.<br /> <br />So I'd like to spread the word. <a href="http://www.vso-software.fr/products/copytodvd/copytodvd.php">VSO CopyToDVD</a> was the <b>ONLY</b> product that worked. It costs a few bucks to buy, but I just downloaded the limited-time trial and it passed the unicode test with flying colours. I didn't really poke around all its features, but it seems to pack the lot. And the fact that I could download it and bang out a few DVDs in short order pretty much sums things up. <br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RkM-u0dCJZI/AAAAAAAAAAc/c4iWiY7LZE8/s1600-h/babel-window.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_AZh6c1pzK1A/RkM-u0dCJZI/AAAAAAAAAAc/c4iWiY7LZE8/s400/babel-window.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062959380169893266" /></a><br />I'll be buying it, and if you also need to burn disks with unicode file/folder names then I can recommend you check it out too.

I was very interested to hear Robyn Williams interview Richard Dawkins for a recent <a href=
"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2007/2023765.htm">Science Show broadcast</a> from the Sydney
Writers' Festival.<br>
<br>
The topic was of course Dawkins'
<a href="https://amzn.to/4ejEeSJ" class="book-title">The God Delusion</a>.
I've yet to read this, but definitely have
it on my reading list now. I remember reading his
<a href="https://amzn.to/4k8KWfs" class="book-title">The Selfish Gene</a>
many years ago, and being
struck by its clarity and compelling proposition. It seems like The God Delusion is cut from the same cloth.
Speaking of cloth, the following is I gather the foreword to the UK edition, and a nice bit of satire;-)<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  [The Courtier's Reply by P.Z. Myers]: I have considered the impudent accusations of Mr Dawkins with
  exasperation at his lack of serious scholarship. He has apparently not read the detailed discourses of Count
  Roderigo of Seville on the exquisite and exotic leathers of the Emperor's boots, nor does he give a moment's
  consideration to Bellini's masterwork, On the Luminescence of the Emperor's Feathered Hat. We have entire
  schools dedicated to writing learned treatises on the beauty of the Emperor's raiment, and every major
  newspaper runs a section dedicated to imperial fashion; Dawkins arrogantly ignores all these deep
  philosophical ponderings to crudely accuse the Emperor of nudity.<br>
  <br>
  Until Dawkins has trained in the shops of Paris and Milan, until he has learned to tell the difference
  between a ruffled flounce and a puffy pantaloon, we should all pretend he has not spoken out against the
  Emperor's taste. His training in biology may give him the ability to recognise dangling genitalia when he
  sees it, but it has not taught him the proper appreciation of Imaginary Fabrics.
</blockquote><br>
Oh, hail the Emperor!

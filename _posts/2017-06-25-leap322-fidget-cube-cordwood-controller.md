A colleague gave us all [Fidget Cubes](https://thefidgetcube.co/), I think mainly to keep idle hands from causing too much mayhem in the office.
After building [Boldport Club Cordwood Too](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/cordwood-too),
I was trying to think of interesting controls for it, and started wondering if the Fidget Cube could be converted into a workable controller.
Answer is: Yes! It was a bit finnecky, but I managed to wire up most of the controls on the cube, and even secret
a power converter inside.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]
Here's a quick demo:

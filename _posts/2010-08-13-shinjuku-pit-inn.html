10th July 2010: Jazz has been huge in Japan since whenever, but unless you go searching, it's easy to miss the fact
that Tokyo has a thumping great live scene. Sites like <a href="http://tokyojazzsite.com/">tokyojazzsite.com</a> are
great for getting around the language barrier.<br>
<br>
So, it's Saturday afternoon and we're looking for a place to chill so we jump on a train to Shinjuku sanchōme and by my
very rough guide we manage to find the Shinjuku Pit Inn. As is always the case with food and music, it's a basement
venue.<br>
<br>
I had no idea who we might get to see, but we were very lucky to catch a 5 piece outfit who played a 3 hour set through
the afternoon (sunglasses definitely required when we emerged back onto the street in the early evening).<br>

This was trad jazz at it's most enthusiastic and dedicated best. Who else would be playing in a dingy, smoke-filled
basement on a Saturday afternoon instead of out shopping or lazing the weekend away?<br>
<br>
And being in the audience is a serious business - the rows of desks are at once a reminder of a stricter scholastic
past and yet a wonderful setting to prop up you G&amp;T, smoke if you please, and just get lost in the music.<br>
<br>
The ¥2500 cover charge (including drink) is not bad. I only wish I had discovered this place when I was working in
Japan. I can't think of a better way of relaxing on a Saturday afternoon.<br>

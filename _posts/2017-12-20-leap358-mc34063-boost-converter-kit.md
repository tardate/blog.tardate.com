The MC34063 is a monolithic DC-to-DC switching controller that can be adapted to step-down, step-up and inverting applications with a minimum of external components.

This module is a very cheap kit designed by ICStation [ICSK034A](http://www.icstation.com/icstation-step-module-boost-converter-power-supply-module-p-4151.html).
It has a fixed converiguration to boost 5V in to 12V out.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

While trying to improve the range of nRF24L01+ some modules, and got distracted into building a channel scanner.
The basic code is from the RF24 library examples, but this gets pimped up with a Nokia 5110 LCD display, multiple modes
and a handy enclosure.

As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

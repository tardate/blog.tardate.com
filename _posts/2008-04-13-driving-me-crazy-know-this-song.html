<span style="font-style:italic;">Someth'n my society...</span> anyone recognise this song? <br /><br />As usual I was casually playing around on my guitar while chilling out, and I hit this chord seuence. Can't vouch for the key, but if you comp this do you recognise it?<br /><blockquote class="code">Am-Am Am Am | Dm7- Dm7 Dm7 Dm7 | <br />E7-E7 E7 E7 | Am-Am Am Am</blockquote>And the chorus/bridge is E7/Am.<br /><br />It's driving me crazy! I know this song. At first I thought Annie Lennox with Dave Stewart doing an acoustic jazz guitar bit, but after 30mins on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mp3">amazon mp3</a> came up empty (such a useful resource though!)<br /><br />If you recognise it ... let me know, and release me from <span style="font-style:italic;">my anxiety</span>!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:bold;">Postcript 2-May-2008: GOT IT! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb2n-hJlRRs">Tanita Tikaram - Twist In My Sobriety</a>.

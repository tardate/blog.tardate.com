<span style="font-style:italic;">Time to drop the cloak of stealth from a new web application I've had in production
for the past month or two..</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://cloudjetty.com">CloudJetty</a> is a site born from my own frustration in trying to find out what was
really available in terms of business applications and services delivered "in the cloud". How do you find what is
available, and how do you know what is trustworthy? That's what CloudJetty is for.<br>
<blockquote class="quote">
  ..a community-maintained buyers' guide to the latest "cloud" services and applications on the web, many for free or a
  nominal monthly subscription.
</blockquote><br>
This is my open invitation for all to check out the site and help it grow..<br>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style: none">

  </li>
  <li>It is still early days, but the first step is just to take it for a test drive! Looking for an invoicing solution
  for your business? <a href="http://cloudjetty.com/business?tags=invoicing">Take your pick</a>. CRM? <a href=
  "http://cloudjetty.com/business?tags=CRM">Of course</a>. Personal backup solutions? <a href=
  "http://cloudjetty.com/personal?tags=backup">Yep</a>. Did you know you can even do BI in the Cloud? <a href=
  "http://cloudjetty.com/business?tags=BI">You bet</a>.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>I'm looking for your help to grow the service listings. Got a favourite cloud/web app you are already using? If
  it's already in CloudJetty, add you rating and recommendation. If it's not there, then please feel free to go ahead
  and add it
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you are a provider of cloud services and applications, I'm especially keen to get your products listed.
  Vendors are welcome to add their own listings, provided they go along with the community-wiki rules: no sales hype;
  and accept that your listings can be edited by others.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>I have no misconception that CloudJetty is perfect. I'd really like to hear about any problems, comments or
  suggestions you may have (there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/cloudjetty">CloudJetty Google
  Group</a> for feedback and discussion, or you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/CloudJetty">CloudJetty</a> on
  twitter)
  </li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>Looking forward to seeing you on CloudJetty!<br>

<h2>
  Do we really need another "Cloud" site?
</h2><br>
Honestly, that was the first thing I thought when contemplating CloudJetty. There are lots of sites with news and
opinion about Cloud. Twitter is full of cloud !spam! Most vendors worth their salt have got a "cloud" section on their
sites. But seriously, I've failed to find much in the way of information for people who don't really want to talk about
cloud, they just want to use what works, and avoid what doesn't.<br>
<br>
The good news is that there's already an incredible range of services available - think of any personal productivity
tool, business application, or infrastructure service, and chances are there's already a cloud service for it (but
whether its any good is another question!)<br>
<br>
And this is only the beginning. salesforce.com may have fired the first shots in the SaaS war and has forever shaken up
the CRM space. And an array of "infrastructure" services (like Amazon EC2) have radically change the economics of a
technology startup. But personally I expect in time we'll see these initial waves dwarfed by the mass migration of
(especially) small business to cloud/web applications that is only now starting to gain momentum.<br>
<br>
Just as this is only the beginning for cloud in general, it's also just the beginning for CloudJetty. Hopefully much
more in store for this site .. but let's not run before we can walk, eh?<br>
<br>
<h2>
  Technically..
</h2><br>
It wouldn't be my tardate blog if I didn't geek out a little and share some of the behind the scenes details.
CloudJetty is written in Ruby on Rails (2.3.4) and of course uses a good handful of gems (like <a href=
"http://github.com/laserlemon/vestal_versions">vestal_versions</a>, <a href=
"http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/">will_paginate</a>, and my own <a href=
"http://github.com/tardate/authlogic_rpx">Authlogic_RPX</a>).<br>
<br>
Best of all, I can get nice and self-referential. CloudJetty, being a application about the cloud, was built using
cloud services, and to find out what cloud services it uses, you can look them up on ... <a href=
"http://cloudjetty.com/bundles/1">CloudJetty</a>;-)

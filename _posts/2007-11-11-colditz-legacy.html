Guy Walters'
<a href="https://amzn.to/4lkEQcO" class="book-title">The Colditz Legacy</a>
is an engaging read. For those of a
certain age and cultural background, Colditz (and especially escape thereof) epitomises a grand Boy's Own
tradition of daring and adventure. Walters picked a great backdrop for his story which features Colditz during
WWII and 30 years on during the cold war. But this story is not about Colditz itself, but the two main
characters; men thrown together during the war which each survived in their own way.<br>
<br>
When I started the book, I assumed the "legacy" must mean something like nazi loot or some deep secret, but it
is much more subtle. There is the idea that in our past we may have performed in way that meets all external,
objective measures of approval but in our hearts is in some way unsatisfactory. This is the legacy we carry
around, even subconsciously. Few may want or get the chance to revisit and rectify this conflict in their
lifetime. This is the story of one man who does.<br>
<br>
I like Guy Walters' writing. I'm sure this won't be the last book of his I read, in fact I have just picked up

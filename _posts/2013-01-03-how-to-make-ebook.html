So eBook sales have surpassed hardcover <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/06/17/ebook-hardcover-sales/">for the first
time</a>, and it is no surprise that the rise of the tablets is the main driver.<br>
<br>
There's something quite comfortable about having a nice digital bundle of information at your fingertips, like warm
buttered toast.<br>
<br>
With relatively open standards and the ubiquity of ereaders, the ebook has become ideal packaging for all manner of
information, from training manuals to open source project documentation. Or even that book that apparently 81% of us
believe we have inside.<br>
<br>
So how do you make an ebook? My first thought on searching for options is that we are pretty spoiled for choice. But
there are important caveats to note, like how Apple iBooks Author can only publish in full fidelity to iTunes Book
Store. And we can't get far before needing to study up on the various formats out there: <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> is widely used, but not without its criticisms and edge-cases especially
when trying to push the boundaries with multimedia and social aspects; the Kindle and other ereaders expect <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOBI">Mobi</a>; and Kindle Fire introduced the <a href=
"https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=200798080">KF8</a> format.<br>
<br>
The good news is that producing pretty standard EPUB, Mobi, PDF and HTML variants of your book can be done very easily
with a range of commercial and non-commercial tools. It's even possible to <a href=
"http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/Introduction.shtml">build an EPUB by hand</a> with just a text editor if you are
game.<br>
<br>
I started to experiment with some open source toolchains to see just how well they work in practice. Personally, I'm
liking the simplicity of using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> to build a range of output
formats from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> source files.<br>
<br>
My experiments are in the <a href="https://github.com/tardate/ebook-toolchains">eBook Toolchains</a> project on github
if you'd like to examine the various approaches I've tried. Have you tried something that's not there? I'd love to hear
about it - comment below or better yet, send me a pull-request on the github project with your examples added!<br>

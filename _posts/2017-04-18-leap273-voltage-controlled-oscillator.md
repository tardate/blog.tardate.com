Based on yet another great [video tutorial from w2aew](https://youtu.be/icw8terKP-M),
this was a successful demonstration of how varicap diodes can be used to create a voltage-controlled oscillator
running in the 14MHz range.
As always, [all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub][project]

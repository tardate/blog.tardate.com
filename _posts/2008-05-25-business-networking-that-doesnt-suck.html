I really like <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Geoffrey Grosenbach's</a> ruby on rails podcast, especially
because it's not just about rails (even though Rails is a keen interest of mine).<br>
<br>
On the latest issue, I was excited to learn about <a href="http://biznik.com/">biznik.com</a>. "<span style=
"font-weight:bold;">Business Networking that Doesn't Suck</span>" as they say.<br>
<br>
I immediately subscribed, but was disappointed to find that there's nothing happening in my local area yet (Singapore),
at least not within 6000km.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://biznik.com/"><img class="centered-image" src=

Something that we should change soon, especially given the attention paid to entrepreneurship in Singapore. Take the
efforts of <a href="http://www.spring.gov.sg/Content/HomePage.aspx">SPRING</a> for example, or the investment that the
government is making in <a href="http://www.idm.sg/">Interactive Digital Media</a>.<br>
<br>
I love the idea of this site, and hope to find some local compatriots up there soon!

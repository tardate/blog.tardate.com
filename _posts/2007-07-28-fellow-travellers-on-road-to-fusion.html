At one point, the cynical would have said that <em>Fusion</em> is just a con to placate all the PeopleSoft, Siebel and JD Edwards customers. Others just complained about the con-fusion.<br /><br />Of course, Fusion Applications are still a way off in the future, and I'm not sure if even Oracle Development really know in full cinematic detail what shipping the products will really entail. Its all still fairly <a href="http://www.oracle.com/applications/fusion-architecture.html">big-picture stuff</a> .. although in classic Oracle style, the user/user experience seems to have got lost along the way. But there's enough <a href="http://oracleappslab.com/">pressure and creativity</a> that I think we will see the current Fusion formula grow an additional term at some point. i.e.<br /><blockquote><strong>Fusion = Grid Computing + SOA + Enterprise Information Architecture</strong><br /><em>will become</em><br /><strong>Fusion = Grid Computing + SOA + Enterprise Information Architecture + Web 2.0</strong></blockquote>In other words, potentially the best darn definition of "Enterprise 2.0" in the market so far!<br /><br />In the meantime however, some things are coming into clear focus. One is the critical importance of SOA and Security Fusion Middleware components (a.k.a. Oracle Application Server). This struck home for me when listening to the recent <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OracleAppcast/~3/133012314/5728514.mp3">AppCast interview with Cliff Godwin</a> who is now heading Oracle's Fusion Upgrade Program Office. <em>What is the world coming to.. Oracle Applications folks selling technology?!!</em><br /><br />The true test of fusion will be the extent to which it is embraced by customers and the user community. It was great to see <a href="http://orclville.blogspot.com">Floyd Teter</a> kick-off a new series on his blog where he will be covering his company's <a href="http://orclville.blogspot.com/2007/07/detailed-roadmap-to-fusion-applications.html">Detailed Roadmap to Fusion Applications</a>. Hats off to Floyd for the courage to do this in the open, and to provide the necessary detail that will actually make this <em>useful </em>for others considering the same path.
